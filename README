Structure of current directory:
0) ./
	include main tex file as well as compilation logs, Makefile and style files
1) mainChapters
	includes text of main chapters of thesis.
2) otherText
	include all other text, as preamble, appendices, etc.

Modification in the primary template done by me:
1) add atlasphysics.sty to the extrastyles.zip. And also use it in Makefile and in preamble.tex
