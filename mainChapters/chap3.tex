This chapter describe LUCID detector which was built specially for Run-2 phase of a LHC program.
It cover aspects as design of the detector and its key components, assembly and testing of the new detector, 
operation and performance of the detector during 2015-2016 years of data taking.
Special attention is given for the calibration system of the detector and developing of the calibration procedure.

During the design phase a lot of tests were done in order to find out optimal design and parameters of detector components.
Also a lot of tests were done in order to understand behaviour and performance of detector components.
During the assembly and installation phase all parts of the detector were taken together. During this phase number of tests were done
to make sure that all components perform as they should.
Also overall testing of the system was done to make sure that no damage was done during the installation of the detector.
During operation phase which is still ongoing a lot of studies were held to understand performance of calibration system and detector overall.

I contributed in each step described above. I took part in developing of LUCID design particularly design of the calibration system. 
I made series of tests to find out optimal parameters of LED and Laser diffusers used to evenly distribute LED and laser signals and deliver it to all detector 
channels. 
Also I spent a lot of time on understanding behaviour of LED system as well as PMT and PIN-diode signal behaviour.
Tests with Bi-207 radioactive source which is used as one of the way to calibrate PMT gain were done as well.
Also I participated in detector assembly in the clean room and did testing of the detector during this process.
Testing of LED and Laser diffuser were done in order to cross check integrity of fibers and homogenity of signals between all PMTs.
Also temperature stress-test was performed in order to undertand maximum possible temperature allowed to not destroy detector during a beam pipe bake out 
procedure.
In the operational phase tests main focus was given for undestanding of aging of PMTs and possibility to improve calibration system.

LUCID group published paper with description of choice and charaterization of photomultipliers for the new LUCID detector for Run-2~\cite{Alberghi:2016tad}.
My contribution was in understanding and developing of absolute calibration using a Bi-207 source.

During my PhD studies I hold a role of ATLAS Forward detectors Run Coordinator with main focus on LUCID for a 5 months.

\section{The new LUCID-2 detector}
\label{sec:LUCID}

[TODO: rewrite thoroughly this subsection!].

LUCID (LUminosity Cherenkov Integrating Detector) is a luminosity monitor with two detectors placed around the beam-pipe on both forward ends of the ATLAS detector. 
Each detector consists of 16 photomultipliers and 4 quartz fiber bundles. The Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMTs) detect charged 
particles that traverse their quartz windows, where Cherenkov light is produced. Cherenkov light is produced in 
the fiber bundles as well and carried to PMTs that are protected by shielding some 2 meters away 
(see \FigureRef{fig:LucidDrawing}). To increase the detector lifetime, only a subset of the PMTs is used at a 
given time, the others being available as spares. In addition, 4 PMTs have a reduced window opening to decrease 
their acceptance and thus avoid saturation of some luminosity algorithms.

and quartz fibers with respect to the LHC beampipe; (right) A quarter of one of the detectors. All tubes are 
placed inside mu-metal shielding to protect the PMTs from a stray field. Cooling pipes were installed in order 
to protect the PMTs from overheating during the beampipe bake-out procedure. Three of four tubes have fiber connectors, which
tranfser LED and laser pulses for calibration. The fourth tube is equipped with a Bi-207 source and is completely 
sealed.}
\label{fig:LucidDrawing}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Motivation of new LUCID-2 detector}
\label{subsec:motivationNewLucid}

[TODO: rewrite thoroughly this subsection!].

With respect to the detector used in Run I~\cite{Aad:2013ucp}, the new LUCID has a reduced material budget, 
an increased dynamic 
range and will measure luminosity with additional algorithms based on PMT charge integration. It also has a 
completely new calibration system.

\subsection{Choice of photomultipliers}
\label{subsec:PMTChoice}

[TODO: rewrite thoroughly this subsection!].

The new LUCID uses R760 Hamamatsu PMTs, a smaller version of the previously used R762 model. These PMTs have a 
10 mm quartz window diameter, while the old ones had a 14 mm diameter. A smaller PMT model has been chosen to reduce acceptance 
which will help to cope with the increased occupancy and to avoid saturation of the luminosity algorithms.
In addition, 4 PMTs per side have a specially reduced sensitive window with a 7 mm diameter which roughly 
corresponds to a factor 2 decrease in rate (see \FigureRef{fig:modPMT}). They provide luminosity algorithms that will not saturate at 
increased luminosity. Detailed description of choise and characterization of PMTs used in detector can be found in~\cite{Alberghi:2016tad}.

[ToASK: Should I add additional information how choise of PMTs was done (as described in the paper~\cite{Alberghi:2016tad})?].
% TODO also mention that below in the text there will be some description of tests done to understand behaviour of PMts?

\label{fig:modPMT}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Read-out electronics}
\label{subsec:LUCIDElectronics}

[TODO: rethink this subsection!].

New readout electronics have been built that consist of VME boards that digitize the PMT signals with FADCs. 
The electronics record hits if the pulseheight is above a threshold and integrate the pulses in each 25 ns 
interval that correspond to a LHC bunch crossing. \FigureRef{fig:pulseShape} shows a typical PMT signal shape in 
a physics run. The duration of the pulses is less than 25 ns.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{LUCID/pulseShape_run_267367_preliminary.eps}
\caption{Digitized pulse shape of a signal from one of the PMTs of the LUCID detector during a run recorded on 
the 10th of June 2015 at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The polarity of the pulse is inverted. The FADCs measure the 
pulse amplitude in time bins that are 3.125 ns long. Taken from Ref.~\cite{publicPlots}.}
\label{fig:pulseShape}
\end{figure}

LUCID read-out consists from four (two per side) custom made VME LUCROD boards which sit close to the detector in ATLAS experimental hall.
Decision to place electronics close to the detector in the experimental hall was motivated by preventing signals to have long tales.
Signal from sensors are transferred with thick cables which prevent distrotions along the path.
Every LUCROD board has 16 input channels. Every channel is consisted from low noise amplifier, filter and Flash ADC.
Block diagram of LUCORD is shown in \FigureRef{fig:LUCROD_schematics}.
Channels are grouped in pairs and for each pair there is a dedicated channel FPGA.
All information from all channel FPGAs are collected and processed by main FPGA.
After that information are sent to the ATLAS as well as for LUMAT boards which are placed in the counting room of the experiment.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{LUCID/LUCROD_schematics.jpg}
\caption{Block diagram of the LUCROD board. Every board host two input channels. Every channel consist from low noise amplifier, flash ADC and FPGA. 
There are 16 channels (8 units) per LUCROD. All units are controlled by main FPGA, which collect information from all channels and make needed calculations.}
\label{fig:LUCROD_schematics}
\end{figure}

There are two LUCROD board per side and it was decided to couple different sets of sensors to the different boards as shown in \FigureRef{fig:Eletronics_schematics}.
Bi, VDM and Spare sensors were connected to the one board while Modified and Fiber sensors were connected to the another board.
The same connection scheme was used on the other side as well.

% TODO change this picture with one which is in lumi note.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{LUCID/Eletronics_schematics.eps}
\caption{Block diagram of the LUCID electronics. Signals from all tubes are collected by 4 \mbox{LUCROD} cards 
(two per 
each side) that digitize the signals with FADCs. Some of the luminosity algorithms are calculated in the LUCRODs. 
Output of these calculations as well as a copy of all digitized PMT 
signals are sent to the LUMAT cards afterwards, which perform calculations of algorithms that combine data from 
both detectors and publish the results to the Information Server (IS) database.}
\label{fig:Eletronics_schematics}
\end{figure}

Every LUCROD boards receive information from sensors from one side only.
In order to implement possibility to look for a coincedence from sensors from both sides two additional boards which are called LUMAT boards are used
as shown in \FigureRef{fig:Eletronics_schematics}.
Digital signals from sensors of the same type from LUCRODs from both side are send to LUMAT boards, which can perform logical operation with signals from both sides.

Information from LUCROD and LUMAT board then are published to Information Server (IS) where futher luminosity calculations are done.

\section{Design of the calibration system}

% TODO add reference to some book with desciption of PMT aging 

[TODO: describe why do we need calibration system. What is the purpose of it. Stress that it's important for correct measurements of luminosity.]

The PMT gain calibration is monitored in 3 independent ways (see \FigureRef{fig:calibrationSystem}):
\begin{itemize}
 \item by LED signals carried by optical fibers;
 \item by laser signals transferred from the calibration system of ATLAS Tile Calorimeter;
 \item by radioactive sources (Bi-207).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{LUCID/calibrationSystem.png}
\caption{The LUCID calibration system. 16 PMTs per side receives light from LEDs and the Tile laser calibration 
system. 
For redundancy, two fibers come from two different LED diffusers (with three LEDs each, monitored by 
PIN-diodes), and two fibers come from one laser diffuser. The four remaining PMTs in each detector are calibrated 
with Bi-207 sources.}
\label{fig:calibrationSystem}
\end{figure}

The availability of three independent calibration methods increase the robustness of the calibration system 
and provide a possibility to cross-check calibration results between the methods.

LED signals provide sharp peaks in the amplitude and charge distributions that are recorded by LUCID.
The stability of the PMT gain is controlled by measuring the mean value of these distributions. 
The stability of the LEDs themselves is controlled by PIN-diodes.
An alternative way of calibration is to use the ratio of the mean charge measured by PMTs with that of the 
PIN-diode. 
This charge is proportional to the LED intensity and by controlling charge ratio allows to rule out any 
dependence of the calibration results on LED intensity fluctuations.
In order to provide the same amount of light simultaneously for all PMTs a special LED diffuser were designed and manufactured.
This is discussed in details at \SectionRef{subsec:LEDDiffuser}.

The Tile calorimeter laser system provides an alternative source of stable light and is treated in the same way
as the LED signals in the calibration procedure. 
The stability of the laser signals is monitored by the Tile calibration system \cite{atlasGeneral}.
The same as LED laser light has to be distributed between the PMTs as well.
Laser light are provided by Tile calibration system by optical fiber which means that another type of the diffuser
has to be used in order distribute light between the PMTs as is described in \SectionRef{subsec:laserDiffuser}.

Bi-207 radioactive sources provide monoenergetic electrons from an internal conversion process with energies 
above the Cherenkov threshold in quartz. These electrons
have enough kinetic energy to penetrate the quartz window of PMT and produce signals similar to the signals 
from high energetic particles from physics runs. The mean of the charge and amplitude 
distributions from the Bi-207 sources are used in the same way as for the two methods described above. 
This method does not suffer from any instability issues~\cite{Alberghi:2016tad}.
It was decided to use liquid Bi-207 source as described in the \SectionRef{subsec:bi207Calibration}.

In the \SectionRef{subsec:calibPerformance} calibration strategy of 2015 and 2016 data-taking period are discussed.

\subsection{LED diffuser}
\label{subsec:LEDDiffuser}

% TODO structure of the section:
% - to describe why we have 2 LED diffusers: why we use filters on one and don't use on another on
% - geometry studies
% - show LED stability plot over time (PIN-diode measurements)
% - filter studies - explain why we have to be below 100mV for PMTs (discuss this with Carla)
% - 
% - 


% light has to be evenly distributed among PMTs
% LED has to be monitored by PIN-diode in order to verify its stability
% geometrical constrain
%   taking into account size of PIN-diode
%   size of support structure for fibers
%   bending of fibers - whole LED diffuser has to be hosted in limited space and fiber cannot be bend to much.
% constrain during production of the diffuser:
%   complexity of drilling holes for fiber for some angles
%   gluing fibers to the diffuser


Despite a simple purpose of LED diffuser to evenly distribute light among PMTs exsistance of a number of constrains lead to necessity to make dedicated study 
to define optimal parameters of the diffuser. Main points which were considered during design phase are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item light has to be evenly distributed among PMTs,
 \item LED has to be monitored by PIN-diode in order to verify its stability,
 \item geometrical constrains such as size of PIN-diode case, limited space for the whole diffuser and limits on bending of fibers has to be taken into account,
 \item production constrains such as complexity of drilling wholes and fiber glueing at specific angles has to be kept in the mind.
\end{itemize}

To meet all these requirements radial design was proposed - a PIN-diode is located aligned with LED axis. Fibers surround PIN-diode case 
evenly with certain angle to the LED axis. Schematic sketch are shown in \FigureRef{fig:AngularMeasurementSetup} and in \FigureRef{fig:LEDDiffuser}.
% TODO insert sketch used for testing.
Such geometry assume that distance between LED and fibers has to be the same for all fibers in order for fibers to pick up the same amount of light.

% As described above main purpose of LED diffuser is to evenly distribute light between PMT-channels. 

% consists from LED itself, set of fibers which deliver light to the PMTs and PIN-diode which is used to monitor
% stability of LED during long time. LED diffuser has to be design in such way, that all PMT channels have to receive the same amount of light.

% TODO define what is LED axis. Try to explain it better.
LED spreadsheet provide information about LED light intensity as a function of angle between observer and LED axis (\FigureRef{fig:AngularDistributionOfLED} (right)).
But in order to make sure that real LEDs correspond to specified charachterisctics a test in the lab was done.
Sketch up of the experimental setup is shown in \FigureRef{fig:AngularMeasurementSetup}.
PMT anode current measurements as a function of fiber angle with respect to LED axis for different distances between 
fiber surface (PIN-diode) and LED were done and results are shown in \FigureRef{fig:AngularDistributionOfLED} (left).
Up to 30\degree light intesity is relatevily homogeneous and for above 30\degree light intensity starting to drop.

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:AngularDistributionOfLED}
\end{figure}

Sensitivity of PIN-diode is significantly smaller than of PMT.
That's why in order to have enough light intensity to see a clear signal with PIN-diode one can imagine to have as small as possible
distance between LED and PIN-diode. But due to the fact that fibers sits around PIN-diode case and due to geometrical constrains 
(diffuser has certain space requirements to meet in order to fit in limited space on top of monoblock) angle between fibers and LED - PIN-diode axis cannot be very big
otherwise fiber has to be bent too much which can bring potential risk of their mechanical damage during detector installation.

The proposed solution was to use 6 mm distance between PIN-diode and LED and 30\degree for fiber angles.

But as it was said before sensitivity of the PMT and PIN-diode are quite different and this leads to another limitation caused by dynamic range of the LUCROD board.
Dynamic range is the maximum possible input voltage to the read-out card (after amplification) up to which the output is linear and thus not saturating.
Dynamic range of the LUCROD card is 1.5 V. 
Input signal are amplified with low noise amplifier with amplification factor of 14, as decribed in \SectionRef{subsec:LUCIDElectronics} 

[TODO amplification factor is not explained in that section  - fix it].

That's mean that maximum possible amplitude from PMT which can be handled by electronics without any saturation is equal slightly above 100 mV.
And this introduce limitation for the diffuser that intensity of the LED cannot be higher than value which provide 100 mV signals from PMTs.
At the same time signal from PIN-diode will be very small and barely measurable.

This fact lead to the idea that it is needed to supress amount of light which goes to the fibers while keep the same amount for PIN-diode.
Solution was to place ring of photo filters which will cover fibers but will not cover PIN-diode.

Two sets of filters with optical densities 0.15 and 0.6 were used. Criterea to choose proper combination of filters was that 
with maximum possible untensity of LED signals from PMTs has to be smaller than maximum allowed inpit signal for the electronics (100 mV).
Measurements with many possible combinations of filters were done in the lab.
Used setup was the same as showed in \FigureRef{fig:AngularMeasurementSetup}. Distance between LED and PIN-diode and fiber angle were set to the values 
decided to be used in the diffuser. Filter were inserted between LED and the fiber to reduce amount of light picked up by fiber.
Measurements were repeated three times for each filter configuration. Results of measurements are showing in \TableRef{tab:FilterChoice}.
It was decided to choose combination with one filter with 0.15 optical density and with one with 0.6 which corespond to 85.33 $\pm$ 0.29 mV.
Amplitude is slightly smaller than threshold value of 100 mVto in order to have safety margin for fibers 
which potentially can be slighthly off from the nominal position in the diffuser.

\end{table}

LED diffuser had to be placed on top of monoblock, where no hard radiation level is expected compared to the are close to the beampiepe where LUCID sits.
But still significant amount of radiation will be present there during collider operation.
No estimation of radiation hardness of the filters were done that's why it was secided to make one diffuser with filters and another one - without.

\subsection{Laser diffuser}
\label{subsec:laserDiffuser}

% TODO Read here: https://www.rp-photonics.com/numerical_aperture.html

Stability of light source used for calibration is very crucial factor for calibration procedure.
That's why instead of relying on only one light source from LEDs it was chosen to employ laser light source 
provided and monitored by Tile calibration system \cite{atlasGeneral} as alternative source of light. 
To distribute light between the channels one cannot use the same diffuser as for LED light, 
due to the reason that laser light is very well collimated while it's not the case for LED.
In order to handle laser light new diffuser was introduced, shematic of which is shown in \FigureRef{fig:laserDiffuserSchematics}.
Diffuser represent itself as a fiber bundle of 48 quartz fibers encased in ferrule connector of 2 mm diameter \FigureRef{fig:laserDiffuserMapping}.
Laser light is delivered from Tile calibration system by single fiber of 0.6 mm in diameter (depicted on the right at \FigureRef{fig:laserDiffuserSchematics}).

\label{fig:laserDiffuserMapping}
\end{figure}

Light travels in the fiber by undergoing multiple total internal reflections from the interface between fiber core and cladding. 
Due to this, light from fiber will come out within a certain cone. The size of the cone is characterized by numerical aperture $NA$ of the fiber which is equal

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:numericalApperture}
 NA = n \sin{\theta_{max}} = \sqrt{n_{core}^2 - n_{cladding}^2},
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium (air in our case), $n_{core}$ is the refractive index of the fiber core, $n_{cladding}$ is the refractive index 
of the cladding and $\theta_{max}$ is half-angle of light cone. That's why light spot produced by light from fiber will become bigger with distance from fiber 
edge. 
That's why to distribute light from fiber to diffuser one need to introduce some air gap between them as shown at \FigureRef{fig:laserDiffuserSchematics}.
Fiber used to deliver laser light has numerical aperture equal to 0.22, which correspond to 3.1 mm air gap distance needed to cover 2 mm surface of diffuser by 
light spot (according to \EquationRef{eq:numericalApperture}).
For calibration purpose light received by each channel have to be approximately equal between channel to channel. But intesity of light is not constant within 
light spot that's why dedicated measurement are needed to find out best air gap distance.
Two conditions have to be met:
\begin{itemize}
 \item light has to be evenly distributed between channels,
 \item preference are given for configurations in which dimmest channel receives maximum possible light.
\end{itemize}
Two fibers from bundle are used for each channel. For small distances between fiber with laser signal and diffuser biggest intensity are expected for central 
region of the diffuser, while for peripheral region - the lowest intensity is expeted. 
Diffuser are conventionally divided to three regions: central, intermediate and peripheral. 
If one of the channel fiber from pair is in central or intermediate region another fiber from pair has to be placed on the most peripheral ring of diffuser.
And if both of fibers from pair are in peripheral region they are placed as close as possible to the center of diffuser.
Pairs which include one fiber in central region are called central fibers and marked in orange color at \FigureRef{fig:laserDiffuserMapping}.
Pair with one fiber from intermediate region are marked with yellow and pairs marked with green color consists from both fibers in peripheral region.






Measurement were done with different air gap distances for fiber pairs (and correspond PMTs) from each category. 
Due to identical structure of fiber bundle on side A and side C (or bundle 1 and 2), detailed measurements
were done only for one bundle and a few points were measured for the second bundle to verify results of first one. Amplitude of PMT signals were measured by 
osciloscope in ATLAS experimental hall. Measurement results are shown at \FigureRef{fig:laserDiffuserDistanceTest}. PMT 1 represent PMTs with central fiber 
pair connecter, PMT 7 - intermediate and PMT 16 and 19 - peripheral fibers for bundle 1 and 2. 
With increasing distance signal amplitude are decreasing for central fibers which is expected. 
Intermediate and peripheral fibers has maximums. Maximum for peripheral fibers correspond to the distance of 4 cm.
Homogenity within all categories are pretty good for 4 cm as well, so it was decided to use this value for final version of the diffuser.
% TODO conclusionts above are very short... Make it longer!!!

% TODO describe some parameters of Tile system with reference to the atlasGeneral

\subsection{PMTs with Bi-207 source}
\label{subsec:bi207Calibration}

In order to exploit Bi-207 calibration one need to put radioactive sourse close to the PMT.
Set of measurements with Bi-207 radioactive source was done in the lab and it was found out that peak from electron source 
(shown in \FigureRef{fig:pulseheight_Bi207}) correspond to approximately 30 photon electrons~\cite{Alberghi:2016tad}.

All measurements in the lab was done with radioactive source encloced in circular case shcematic of which is shown in \FigureRef{fig:Bi207_case} 
(the source itself was enclosed in disc with diameter of 5 mm).
During the measurements the source was put in contact with PMT quartz windows.
And strong dependence of shape of charge and pulseheight distributions (such as in \FigureRef{fig:pulseheight_Bi207}) 
was observed depending from the relative position of the source with respect to the center of PMT quartz window.
This fact means that it would be extremely difficult position sources in the same way for all sets of PMTs.
That's why it was decided to use liquid Bi-207 source and put it on the whole surface of the quartz window eliminating geometrical factor in such way.
In order to prevent leaking of the source a special cup was glued on top of the PMT.

\subsection{Calibration strategy during 2015-2016}
\label{subsec:calibPerformance}

Between three available calibration methods LED and laser calibrations suffer from two following effects.
The first one is that stability of the light source is very crucial for calibration correctness.
The second one is related to the fact that wavelenght of both LED and laser are different from the 
wavelenght of Cerenkov radiation. 
One need to keep it in the mind while using these calibration methods that quantum efficiency of cathide depends from the wavelenght 
and this dependence can potetially change over the PMT aging.


Bi-207 calibraiton doesn't suffer from these two effects. That's why it became first priority calibration in 2015.

% TODO show that PMT gain goes significantly lower with stable beams with time

The idea of the calibration is to keep gain of PMT on the constant level.
Due to the fact that luminosity during 2015-2016 are significantly higher compared to 2011-2012
aging effect become visible already after a few hours of the beam collisions.
The strategy was to make calibration runs after each physics run.
During the calibration the mean truncated charge distribution from Bi-207 source is measured for each PMT.
This values directly correlate with gain of PMTs. 
And in order to keep gain of the PMT on the same level it is enough just to keep the mean truncated charge distribution on the same level.
After each calibration run mean for each tube is compared to the reference values and if there is significant difference automatic script perform HV adjustment 
in order to normalize PMT gain.

This procedure was used for 2015 and 2016 and was proved to be highly effective and robust.

LED calibration is not fully understood yet due to the fact that gain does not look to be kept on the same level.

[ToASK: should I try to explain the reason why LED calibration doesn't work?].

Laser calibration was not studied enough as well due to the reason that laser source is controlled by the Tile subsystem and require 
precise coordination with Tile subdetector to share one resources between two experiments.

[ToDO: add trending plot of the mean truncated charge over the time for Bi-207 tubes].

\section{PMT gain temperature dependence and calibration fibers temperature tolerance}
\label{sec:tempMeas}

During the first long LHC shutdown (LS1) between 2013 and 2015 beampipe at the interaction point of ATLAS
had to be removed and to be replaced with the new one made of aluminium instead of stainless steel.
New material was chosen to minimise the induced radioactivity of the beampipe (see \FigureRef{fig:metalSupportAndTempProbes} (left)).
Also the new beampipe have reduced aperture to allow accommodating of new pixer inner barrel layer (IBL) of the inner tracker.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{???}
\label{fig:metalSupportAndTempProbes}
\end{figure}


In order to remove residual gas molecules from the inner walls of the new beampipe (which otherwise will lead to significant beam-gas interactions during operation)
the beampipe has to undergo so called ``bake-out'' process, which consists of heating up the walls of the beam pipe from the outside.

Due to fact that LUCID sits tightly around beampipe there was a need to understand temperature tolerance of the detector components.
During the design phase special cooling for detector was made in order to protect PMTs, cables and calibration fibers against potential overheating.
PMTs were placed on special metal supports which are cooled down by water pipes.
Fiber and cables goes along the beampipes for a few meters and are more exposed than PMTs.
% TODO redo a little bit following sentence
They also are protected with cooling pipes but it was practically imposible to make cooling along the whole path of fibers,
that's why there are some areas were fibers are not cooled down by the water pipes.

Special studies was done in order to understand the temperature tolerance of the quartz fibers used in detector, which is described in current section.

% TODO Describe temperate probes... probably somewhere before!!!

Another temperature test described in the section was focused on understanding of the temperature dependence of the PMTs gain during their operation.



% In current section measurements of temperature dependence of PMT gain and behaviour of quartz fiber at high temperatures will be discussed.

\subsection{Temperature controller}
\label{subsec:tempController}

In order to perform any temperature tests one need to have a reliable method to measure and control temperature in a testing area.
Measurements with PMTs are typically done in a light tight black boxes to make sure that no external light will accidently get on PMT photocathode.
Also black box is well sealed hermetically which prevent air from the box to leak outside which make it easy to control temperature inside the box with good 
precision.
A dedicated temperature controller, based on Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller~\cite{arduino} (programmed by Arduino software) was built.
To measure temperature LM35CAH sensor was used which is a precision integrated-circuit device with an output voltage linearly-proportional to the Centigrade 
temperature.
In order to interface the sensor with readout input channel from Arduino board electrical circuit shown at \FigureRef{fig:tempReadOutCircuit} have been made, 
to match output voltage from sensor to readout of Arduino board.
As a heater element a simple chain of resistors were used which were dissipating heat produced by current flowing thorough them. 
Voltage on resistors was controlled by controller with help of MOSFET transistor. In order to verify that temperature will be homogenious within black box,
a pc fan was used. A heating profile was programmed in the Arduino microcontroller.
Measured temperature values were sent directly to pc by serial port or were stored on external microSD card, connected to the Arduino board.

\subsection{PMT gain dependence}
\label{subsec:pmtGainTempDep}

It is known that PMT is more sensitive to ambient temperature than ordinary 
electronic components (such as capacitors and resistors)~\cite{hamamatsu}.
It is caused mainly by two factors: cathode quantum efficiency is sensitive for 
temperature variations and gain of the dynode chain depends from temperature as well.

To estimate a temperature effect on PMT gain dedicated measurement in the lab were done. 
R760 Hamamatsu tube was placed in the black box and was coupled with Bi-207 radioactive source
to provide stable input signal over the time. Temperature in the box was controlled by the temperature controller described in 
\SectionRef{subsec:tempController}.

Due to the fact that interior of PMT is a vacuum and that heat conduct thought it very slowly temperature gradient has to be very small in order to make sure 
that temperature of the tube reaches the same level as the ambient (measured) temperature.
In order to satisfy this condition temperature gradient was choosen to be 0.2\degree~C per hour.

% TODO link. Also put some information about v1720 (probably from Vincents note).
% TODO explain what is the difference between this one and the one which is used in final verison of LUCRODs.
% TODO probably make it not here.
PMT signal is digitized by a 12 bit VME Flash ADC (FADC) which is operated by ATLAS cental Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) framework.
Ir order to write only signals from Bi-207 source a triggering was done only on signal above certain threshold.
A digitized pulse height of every triggerred event was stored in ROOT file on local disc of the lab pc.

Shape of digitized pulse from Bi-207 source is shown at \FigureRef{fig:bi207DigitizedPulse}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{LUCID/rndmPulse_1_mod.pdf}
\caption{Shape of digitized pulse from Bi-207 source. Something about baseline substraction??? }
\label{fig:bi207DigitizedPulse}
\end{figure}

In order to calculate charge and amplitude of Bi-207 signal baseline has to be subtracted. 
To estimate baseline value last 30 (out of 80) samples were used as shown in \FigureRef{fig:bi207DigitizedPulse}.

Recorded rate of Bi-207 signals was equal around 150-200 Hz. In order to collect enough statistics to measure mean of charge and amplitude distributions
every measurement was done for 5 minutes. After one measurements was finished another one was immediately started.
Due to very small temperatutre gradient (0.2\degree~C per hour) temperature within one measurement was considered to be stable.

Mean of charge distribution and temperature as a function of time is shown in \FigureRef{fig:PMTChargeTempDep}.
Black markers represent measurements of ambient temperature. Temperature was slowly increasing and total change was 6\degree~C over 30 hours.
With red markers mean of charge distribution over 5 minutes per measurement is shown.
A clear decreasing trend is observed which represent temperature dependence of PMT gain.
Measured temperature dependence is 0.25 $\%$ of gain per 1\degree~C.

\subsection{Calibration fibers bake-out test}

% From https://indico.cern.ch/event/315665/contributions/1690160/attachments/605816/833747/LS2_LHC_paper_rev_final-1.pdf
% 
% In 2015 year during first long shutdown (LS1) a central ATLAS beampipe made from Ferum (???) 
% was changed with a new one made from Beryllium and Aluminium to better deal with material activation and background ~\ref{Baglin:1967027}.
% New beampipe has to be purified in order to prevent dust particles appear inside the pipe.
% Beampipe is heated up to 350 \degree~C for a few hours. This procedure is called beampipe bakeout.
% 
% The LUCID detector sits on supporting structure (gray structure in \FigureRef{???})
% 
% dedicated cooling has to be installed to protect PMTs and calibration fibers.
% To understand how efficient cooling is needed 
% one need to know temperature robustness of detector components.
% % TODO what about temperature robustness of PMTs? do we know level at which they start to destroy? why we only did this test for fibers?
% % Becuase used PMTs in detector are quite small it makes them quite easy to cool down. 
% Calibration fibers goes from PMTs close to beampipe all along to LED and laser diffusers which are placed on top on monoblock structure 
% %  TODO some other picture???
% (see \FigureRef{fig:LucidDrawing} (left)).
% That's why fibers can be potentially overheated at some parts. 
% In order to understand which temperaure fibers can handle dedicated measurement was done. 


Idea of the test was to estimate temperature threshold at which fibers start to loose their optical properties
by heat damages of cladding and/or fiber core.

Experimental setup was consisted from PMT placed in the black box, LED source and fiber bundle.
Light was transmitted from LED to the PMT by fiber.
Fiber bundle was plased in thermoinsulated box, while LED and PMT were outside and not heated.

High ambient temperature inside the box was reached with help of thermogun, which was blowing hot ait inside the box constantly.
Temperature was measured with Arduino-based temperature controller described in \SectionRef{subsec:tempController}, with only temperature probe inside the box.
% TODO do we really use Arduino-based temperature controller in this test?

First set of measurements were done with room temperature inside the box in order to use this value as a reference (first phase of the experiment).
In the second phase thermogun was switched on and temperature raised to around 95\degree~C.
This temperature was kept constant for a slightly more than one hour to make sure that fiber was exposed to high temperature for
long enough time period to make changes observable if any. 
% TODO end of previous sentence is a little bit weird... rephrase it!
In the third phase power of thermogun was incread and temperature of air was raised to 110\degree~C and it was kept on this level for one hour as well.
On the last phace thermogun was switched off and measurements were done for half an hour more.
LED was pulsed by pulse generator with rate of ??? kHz and FADC was triggered with the same signal in order to make sure that only signals originated from LED 
source were stored.
Every measurement was done for 5 minute and next one was started as soon as last one was finished.
Mean of charge distribution was calculated for each measurement and is shown as function of time with red markers in \FigureRef{fig:fiberBakeOut}.
Black markers correspond to temperature measurements done in the same time.
Charge measurements during second phase when temperature in the box was 95\degree~C are compatible with measurements done for the first phase 
(with room temperature).
And they are stable during all phase two (which was one hour) which proofs that fibers can operate normally with this temperature.
During the third phase (110\degree~C) significant decreasment of measured charge is observed, which demonstrates some changes in the
optical properties of the fiber. On the last phase temperature went back to room values and charge partially increased back but didn't reach 
nominal values which indicate unrecoverable damage of the fiber at 110\degree~C temperature.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{LUCID/fiberBakeOut.png}

\label{fig:fiberBakeOut}
\end{figure}

% TODO rephrase a little bit here...
This test demonstrated that there is big probability that calibration fibers will be damaged if they will be exposed 
with temperature above 95\degree~C for long period of time.

% TODO probably it's better to remove this...
% But due to fact that bake-out procedure was planned to be done with around 220\degree~C and early
% simulations showed that expected temperature on LUCID area can be around 140\degree~C 
% % TODO find proof of this!!!
% efficient cooling for fibers became mandatory requirement for the system.
% 
% Decision was to use water cooling. 
% To make cooling of PMTs efficient dedicated metal support was designed to host PMTs shown in \FigureRef{fig:PMTMetalSupport}.
% Water pipes were positioned under this support.
% To protect calibration fibers from overheating they were bundled and glued around cooling pipe which was placed along 
% the beampipe (see \FigureRef{fig:temperatureProbes_VJCone}).
% 
% Also to provide circulation of air in the detector region additional air cooling was installed. 
% [according to Giulio air circulation was essential in order to make sure that some gas will not get into PMTs???]

 
\subsection{Temperature conditions during beampipe bake-out and detector operation period}

LUCID detector is equipped with 18 temperature sensors per side which were installed (\FigureRef{fig:metalSupportAndTempProbes} (right))
to monitor temperature of the detector components during bake-out procedure of the new ATLAS beampipe and during detector operation.
Temperature from all sensors is recording and archiving every 10 seconds.

Temperature from sensor placed in the cable tray and the beam pipe flange during the beampipe bake-out is shown in \FigureRef{fig:NEG_ctflangeA}.
Temprerature were well within safety margin and didn't exceed 40\degree~C. Temperature from other sensors didn't exceed 40\degree~C as well.
It demonstrate high efficiency of beampipe insulation and water cooling system and proove that no damage to the LUCID detector components were done.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{LUCID/NEG_ctflangeA.png}
\caption{???}
\label{fig:NEG_ctflangeA}
\end{figure}
 

% Temperature of the sensors during data-taling:
After bake-out procedure temperature was constantly monitored to make sure that there was no big fluctuations in the cavern.
A few sensors were installed close to the PMTs and their measurements can be treated as an approximate temperature of the PMT tubes.
Temperature during data-taking period in 2015 and 2016 years are shown in \FigureRef{fig:???}. 
There are no significant fluctuation over all period and they are within ?\degree~C.
According to the measurements described in \SectionRef{subsec:pmtGainTempDep} PMT gain temperature dependence correspond
to 0.25 $\%$ per 1\degree~C, which is negligable for present temperatuve variations during the data-taking period.

\section{The LUCID luminosity measurements}

[WARNING: this section is work in the progress].

Luminosity is measured by LUCID from a measurement of the number of PMT-hits, the number of bunch crossings 
with at least one PMT-hit and the integrated pulseheight (charge). These measurements are done over a time 
period called a luminosity block, which are typically 1 minute long and they are done for each of the 
individual bunch crossings in the LHC. 
The new electronics provides luminosity measurements using 124 different algorithms which take as input 
different combination of hits or charge from different tubes. Algorithms, which are based on PMT-hits from only 
one of the detectors (either A or C), are calculated by the LUCROD VME custom boards, while algorithms which depend on 
combination of hits from both detectors are calculated by the LUMAT boards (see 
\FigureRef{fig:Eletronics_schematics}).
The luminosity is proportional to the measured charge which is in turn proportional to the logarithm of the measured 
number of PMT-hits *** add log formula for lumi ***. The two types of measurements therefore have different limitations. 
The main issue with the 
charge measurement is PMT gain stability while the hit measurements can suffer from pile-up of several signals 
below threshold giving a signal above threshold.
% Figure~\ref{fig:hitCount} shows the number of PMT-hits from different LHC bunches. The large peaks correspond 
% to six trains of 
% six colliding bunches each, plus two isolated colliding bunches. Two smaller peaks that correspond to bunches 
% with only one beam are also seen. The baseline background level is due to the Bi-207 source used for monitoring 
% of the photomultiplier gain. 


\subsection{Luminosity algorithms}



\subsection{First 13 TeV collisions at the LHC}
\label{sec:physics}

The LHC reported the first 13 TeV pp collision in May of 2015 and these were recorded by ATLAS and other LHC 
experiments. 
Starting from that time the new LUCID was succesfully operating and provided information about the 
luminosity delivered to ATLAS. 
% More than a femtobarn of luminosity is already recorded by ATLAS, which provides a
% sufficient amount of data about the performace of the LUCID detector with a high number of pp-interaction per bunch 
% crossing.

The PMT pulseheight distribution in a physics run is shown in the left plot of \FigureRef{fig:Pulseheight} (blue) 
together with the same distribution 
during a Bi-207 calibration run (red). In both distributions a peak due to Cherenkov photons is visible. The 
calibration distribution is cut due to the threshold in the electronics that define a PMT-hit.

\end{figure}


In the right plot of \FigureRef{fig:Pulseheight} a comparison of the pulseheight distributions in a physics run 
with
low-$\mu$ (red) and high-$\mu$ (blue) are shown. The pulse height is shifted towards higher values when at high 
luminosity several particles traverse the photomultiplier window in the same bunch crossing.


LUCID can measure luminosity in many ways and \FigureRef{fig:InternalConsistency} shows a comparison of the 
luminosity measured by an A and 
a C detector for different ATLAS data taking runs. The two measurements agree to better than 0.5$\%$.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{LUCID/InternalConsistency_preliminary.pdf}

detector. The agreement between the two LUCID arms is better than 1$\%$. Taken from Ref.~\cite{publicPlots}.}
\label{fig:InternalConsistency}
\end{figure}

The left plot of \FigureRef{fig:LumiVsTime} shows a measurement of the average number of inelastic pp collisions 
using different ATLAS 
luminometers and the right plot shows the ratio of this measurement with respect to a LUCID measurement. One of the 
detectors shows a deviation of up to 2$\%$ during this LHC fill but the other measurements are all in agreement 
with LUCID to better than 0.5$\%$.

\end{figure}

The first month of data taking with the new detector therefore showed that LUCID could measure the relative 
luminosity with a precision of about 0.5$\%$.
