\toAsk[shoud I use ``same-sign'' or ``like-sign''? Can I use both simultaneously?]

\toDo[no jet selection]
\toDo[add Fast/Full sim systematics]

The idea of the current analysis is to make a general search for a new physics in a same-sign dilepton channel. \toFix
% Why do we use leptons as final objects?
Leptons as a physics signature are very clean and straighforward observalbles. 
ATLAS detector capable to detect leptons with amazing momentum resolution precision... \toFix[show some resolution plot]

In resonant searches for new physics using leptons are beneficial due to fact that resonance peak for potential BSM signals will be narrower with compariosn to e.g. using jets.
Because energy of leptons is reconstructed very well resonance peaks 
BSM bosons whose decay would manifest itself as a narrow resonance in the dilepton mass spectrum

% Why do we use same-sign dilepton channel
Looking for a same-sign dilepton channel is motivated by the fact that cross section for SM processes with such signature are really small, which make 
it very sensitive possible signals of new physics.  \toFix
% Why model-independent search
There are other searches in ATLAS which taget the same final signature but with requiring additional cuts on number of jets \toFix[link] of missing transverse energy \toFix[link].
In such way these analyses target limited number of specific models.
Analyses presented in this chapter aims to be more general and model-independent. 
\toFix[Explain which models does this analysis cover?]

\section{Background processes}
\label{sec:wprimeBackgrounds}
% ******************************************************************************
% TODO
% - describe that there are hree possibilities to reconstruct same-sign lepton pair
% - 
% ******************************************************************************


There are three different components which contribute to the signal selection.
The first component is so called prompt contribution when same-sign dilepton originates from the SM processes.
Just a few SM processes contribute to the same-sign dilepton final state. In such processes same-sign leptons originates from semi-weakly decay of top quark
and/or leptonic decays of $W, Z$ bosons. Some example of the Feynman diagrams are shown in \FigureRef{fig:Diboson_feynman}.
Overall SM processes with same-sign dilepton final state have relatively small cross section.

The second component comes from the wrong reconstruction of the lepton itself, when pion or jet is reconstructed as a lepton or from leptons which were born 
not in the pp collision but from decays of secondary particles, e.g. kaons. This component is called non-prompt or fake component.

The third component comes from misidentification of the electrical charge of the lepton, which make processes, where opposing lepton pair is produced, 
contribute to the signal selection as well. The charge misidentification effect become significant for high-momentum leptons, when curvature of the track 
is hard to reconstruct. Also events where prompt electron emit photon due to bremsstrahlung, which in its turn create an electron-positron pair.
One leptons from pair then can form a same-sign electron pair with original prompt lepton. These two processes are referred as charge misidentification or
charge flip later in the text.

The last component originates from $W\gamma$ process, where an electron-positron pair is created from photon conversion and by combination with electron from $W$ decay
same-sign lepton pair can be formed. It is considered separately from charge flip background because it does not contain prompt opposite-sign electron pair.

% TODO describe connection of written above with table with all used MC samples...
% TODO normalization is just checked for it is not applied as a scale factor. Cross check with Monika!!!
Prompt contribution is described by the MC simulation. 
% with applying the overall normalization of the MC samples to the data in the control region.
Non-prompt contribution is derived with the data-driven method, so called fake factor method.
Charge flip rate is estimated from Z boson lepton decays and is applied to the opposite-sign MC samples.

List of all used MC samples are shown in \TableRef{tab:MC_cross}. All other processes which are not listed in the table don't contribute
significantly to the same-sign selection and are considered negligable.

\section{Event selection}
% TODO mention here about size of the dataset and that it was 8 TeV 50 ns data.
% TODO description of the used triggers here!

% TODO ToTHINK MC cross section and sample sizes\toFix

Events of interest are events which have two high-$p_T$ isolated leptons \toFix

20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected at 8 TeV center of mass energy pp collisions, with mean number of interactions per crossing equal to 21, 
with 50 ns bunch distance were used for the analysis.
Firstly events are required to have at least one reconstructed primary vertex with at least three tracks matched to it. If there are few vertices, the one with the highest
$\sum p^2_T$, where $p_T$ is transverse momenta of the tracks, is chosen.
Events which pass \toFix trigger, which selects events with two isolated \toFix leptons with $p_{T}>25$\toFix and $p_{T}>20$\toFix, were selected.
% TODO Cleaning and all other event-related cuts to describe here...

\subsection{Electron selection}
\label{subsec:electron_selection}

Electron candidates are reconstructed by matching of the track from ID with energy deposits in the EM calorimeter.

\toDo[explain how electron energy is measured]
\toDo[describe three chanels: ee, emu, mumu]

Electrons used for the signal selection are required to satisfy critereas:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $p_T > 20$ GeV. To ensure a high and flat trigger efficiency and to harmonize $p_T$ requirement between three analysis channels ($ee$, $\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$) 
 \item $|\eta|<2.47$ to be within high-granularity acceptance of EM calorimeter, but excluding barrel-end-cap transition region $1.37<|\eta|<1.52$.
 \item Transverse and longitudinal impact parameters $|d_0|/\sigma(d_0) < 3$ and $|z_0 \times sin \theta| < 1$ mm. 
 To verify that electron was born close to the primary vertex and to reject electrons which were originated from the decay of long-lived particles.
 \item To pass ``tight'' electron set of identification criterea defined in~\cite{electron_tight}. \\ 
 \toFix[explain shortly purpose of the cut]
 \item To pass isolation requirement. To distinguish prompt electrons from those associated with jet activity.
 \item No reconstructed jet within $\Delta R < 0.4$ \toFix[define R]. To remove ambiguous clasification of the track, when track is clasified as electron and as jet simultaneously. 
 Or when jet is too close to the electron which will lead to poor reconstruction of latter. 
\end{itemize}

Isolation requirement were chosen in order to reach pile-up independent efficiency of more than 99$\%$ for electrons 
with $p_T >$ 40 GeV. The requirement has two parts.
Firstly, the sum of the transverse energies in the EM and hadronic calorimeters around the electron within 
$\Delta R < 0.2$, with core electron energy subtracted from the sum, has to be less than 
3 GeV $+ (p_T - 20$ GeV$) \times 0.037$, where $p_T$ is electron transverse momentum.
Secondly, the sum of the $p_T$ of all tracks with $p_T > 0.4$ GeV within $\Delta R < 0.3$ around the electron track has
to be less than 10$\%$ of electron $p_T$.

Electrons used in control regions are required to fail one or few requirements above but pass looser one.

\subsection{Definition of same-sign electron pair}
% TODO inv. mass cut; treatment of event with three leptons;
All electrons which passed selection are considered while forming a lepton pair.
All combinations are checked and it is allowed to have more than one pair selected in one event.
Electrons in the pair are chatechorized by the $p_T$: electror with higher $p_T$ is called leading lepton, while another one with lower $p_T$ subleading lepton.
Leading lepton have to pass more strict cut $p_T>25$ GeV cut while subleading lepton have to satisfy $p_T>20$ GeV as described above.

If event contains an opposite-sign same flavour lepton pair which satisfies condition $( |m_{\Plepton\Plepton} - m_{Z}| < 10$ GeV$)$,
where $m_{\Plepton\Plepton}$ is lepton pair invariant mass and $m_{Z}$ is mass of Z boson, event is discarded.
This significantly suppress prompt background.

To avoid low-mass hadronic resonances like $J/\psi$ or $\varUpsilon$ to show up in the mass spectrum only same-sign pair with $m_{\Plepton\Plepton}>15$ GeV are selected.
Aditionaly, if same-sign lepton pair satisfies $70 < m_{\Plepton\Plepton}< 110$ GeV, which corresponds to the Z peak region, event is removed.
This region is used for estimation of the electron charge misidentification background.

\section{Estimation of the charge flip and non-prompt backgrounds}

\subsection{Prompt opposite-sign dilepton with charge flip}
% TODO
% subsection flow:
% CF sources --> method and used regions --> validation of the method --> deriving scale factors --> appling to specific MC samples
\toDo[description how charge flip rate was obtained, and plots if CF rate vs. pT and eta.]
\toAsk[why we define CF rate in 80..100 GeV region, while we cut 70..110 GeV from signal region?]
\toAsk[CF at high pT. extrapolation? of one large bin with huge error? look it up!]

Since the charge of one of the reconstructed electrons from the pair can be missidentified, 
opposite-sign dilepton final state processes can contribute as a background for the same-sign dilepton signal selection.
Because background is relatevily small in the signal selection a charge flip cannot be neglected and have to be properly estimated. Two cases are considered as a charge flip. When electron charge is actually misreconstructed due to matching of the wrong track to the EM cluster or by too small curvature of the high-momentum track. Or when electron emit a photon by bremsstrahlung, which decays to electron-positron pair. 

In order to estimate how many events with opposite-sign dileptons will ``leak'' to same-sign dilepton signal region one
need to know charge flip rate for electrons. It is expected that charge flip will depends from electron momentum (due to track curvature) and from $\eta$ (due to different geometry of the detector versus $\eta$).

Electrons from Z boson decay provide a great possibility to estimate charge flip rate. By applying signal selection
and requiring invariant mass of the lepton pair to be around Z mass, $80 < m_{ee} < 100$ GeV, one obtain a pure
sample of electron pairs, with one electron with missidentified charge. Knowing number of opposite- and same-sign
pairs one can extract charge flip rate.

In \FigureRef{fig:chargeFlip_structure} charge flip rate obtained from MC simulation as a function of $p_T$ is shown.
Contribution from photon conversion from bremsstrhulng process is shown separately. This contribution is dominant 
to charge flip rate over all $p_T$ range except high-$p_T$ region, where dominant effect become misreconstruction 
of charge due to very small curvature of tracks.

\begin{figure}

\caption{\toDo[caption]}
\label{fig:chargeFlip_structure}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To verify estimation of charge flip by MC simulation a special data-driven technique, so-called likelihood method, was used, which is described in~\cite{same_sign_paper_7tev}. To cross-check that applicability of the method it was used on 
MC simulation first and chrage flip rates were compared with the one from generator level (``truth'') information. 

Comparison demonstrates that likelihood method provide very reliable results as shown in
\FigureRef{fig:likelihood_cross_check}.

\caption{\toDo}
\label{fig:likelihood_cross_check}
\end{figure}

Charge flip rate as a function of $p_T$ and $\eta$ is shown in \FigureRef{fig:charge_flip_data_vs_mc}.
Comparison between MC simulation and likelihood data-driven predictions are shown. 
Dependence of the rate as a function of $p_T$ is well described by MC simulation, while some difference can be observed
for high $\eta$ region. This is why $\eta$ dependent scale factors were obtained in order to correct MC prediction.

\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

\caption{\toDo}
\label{fig:charge_flip_data_vs_mc}
\end{figure}

For prediction of the charge flip in the signal region MC simulation of processes which produce opposite-sign pairs
were used (which are shown in \TableRef{tab:MC_cross}). Reconstructed same-sign lepton pairs were corrected by 
charge flip scale factor.

% TODO systematics on CF scale factor
To estimate systematic error of the derived scale factors following uncertainty sources were considered:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The width of the invariant mass window, used to preselect electrons from $Z$ peak, were varied by 10 GeV.
 The largest difference between central value scale factors and scale factor obtained from variation was taken as systematic error.
 \item The electron isolation requirement were loosed by 4 GeV in both track- and calorimeter-based isolation criteria.
\end{itemize}
Electrons from Z decays have limited $p_T$-range up to around 100 GeV. As can be seen in~\FigureRef{fig:charge_flip_data_vs_mc} (right), 
MC simulation describe $p_T$ dependence of the charge flip rate very good, that is why it was decided to rely on MC simulation 
for the high-$p_T$ leptons. Additional studies were done to estimate systematic uncertainty in this case.
A detector alignment and amount of detector material was varied in order to get an effect on charge flip rate.
Conservative estimation of 20$\%$ of error were assigned to high-$p_T$ lepton charge flip.

Total systematic uncertainty on the background prediction is shown in~\TableRef{tab:syst}.

Charge flip scale factor and uncertainty are applied for the MC prediction of the contribution from $W\gamma$ process to the signal as well.
\toAsk[should I say smth. more about $W\gamma$ process]

\subsection{Non-prompt background}
\toDo[short description of the fake factor method. Put details on which regions were used.]
\toDo[reference to Anthonys thesis]

Other background which is present after the signal selection is the so-called non-prompt background.
Main sources of this background are jets misidentified as electrons and electrons originating not from 
the primary vertex, such as electrons from semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavor quarks ($b$, $c$).
To estimate this background a data-driven method, the so-called fake factor method, is used.

The idea of the method is following. 
First one need to define a background region, which will not overlap with the signal selection.
Contribution from prompt electrons in this region have to be small and while contribution from non-prompt electrons have to be dominant.
For this purpose a dijet data sample is used. It must contain strictly one reconstructed electron with $p_T > 20$ GeV
and a side away jet in the opposite azimuthal direction ($\Delta \phi (e,jet) > 2.4$).
By requiring strictly one electron one can make sure that background region will not overlap with the signal selection and processes 
like Drell-Yan and \ttbar~will be supressed.
To make sure that away side jet and non-prompt electron are well balanced in terms of energy, away side jet is
requested to have $p_T < 30$ GeV.
To supress contribution from W boson production processes requirement on transverse invariant mass 
$m_\mathrm{T} > 40$ GeV is applied.
\footnote{$m_\mathrm{T} = \sqrt{2 p_\mathrm{T} E_\mathrm{T}^{miss} (1-\cos\varphi_{\Plepton\nu})}$, where
$p_\mathrm{T}$ is transverse momentum of the electron, $E_\mathrm{T}^{miss}$ is transverse missing energy of the event
and $\varphi_{\Plepton\nu}$ is the angle between of them.}

In this background region one determine a fake factor $f$ as:
\begin{equation}
f = \frac{N_{\mathrm{P}} - N_{\mathrm{P}}^{\mathrm{prompt}}}{N_{\mathrm{F}}  - N_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{prompt}}}.
\label{eq:fakefactor}
\end{equation}
where $N_{\mathrm{P}}$ is number of electrons in the background region which pass electron signal selection,
described above in \SectionRef{subsec:electron_selection} and $N_{\mathrm{F}}$ is number of electrons which do not meet 
signal electron selection requirements but satisfy a looser selection. Looser selection is identical for signal selection except 
requirement that electron have to satisfy ``medium'' electron set of identification criteria~\cite{electron_tight} (instead of ``tight'') 
and it have to fail the calorimeter-based or track-based isolation requirement, or both.
$N_{\mathrm{P}}^{\mathrm{prompt}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{prompt}}$ are numbers of prompt
leptons, obtained from MC simulation, which pass signal and looser selections accordingly.
Contribution of prompt leptons have to be subtracted in order to make sure that 
fake factor is properly defined as a ratio of non-prompt electrons passed signal selection over 
the number of non-prompt electrons passed looser selection.
When fake factor have been measured in the background region with dijet data sample it can be applied for the dilepton data sample of interest.
In order to take into account possible different kinematics of a lepton in the region were fake factor was derived 
and region were it will be applied, fake factor is measured as a function of electron $E_\mathrm{T}$ and $\eta$.
The total number of the events, $N_{\mathrm{NP}}$, of non-prompt background in the delipton signal region can be estimated as:
\toAsk[is phrasing above clear enough?]
\begin{equation}
N_{\mathrm{NP}} = \sum_{i}^{\mathrm{N_{P_l F_s}}} f_{\mathrm{s}}(p_{\mathrm{Ti}},|\eta_{i}|) + \sum_{i}^{\mathrm{N_{F_l P_s}}} f_{\mathrm{l}}(p_{\mathrm{T}i},|\eta_{i}|) - \sum_{i}^{\mathrm{N_{F_l F_s}}} f_{\mathrm{l}}(p_{\mathrm{T}i},|\eta_{i}|) \times f_{\mathrm{s}}(p_{\mathrm{T}i},|\eta_{i}|).
\label{eq:fake_pred}
\end{equation}
where the first term corresponds to the number of electron pairs ($N_{P_l F_s}$) 
where the leading electron (denoted by ``l'') passes selection criteria ($P_l$) and subleading electron 
(denoted by ``s'')
fails to fulfil it ($F_s$), but passes the looser selection used for fake factor calculation. 
Contribution of every such pair to the signal region is scaled by the fake factor 
$f_{\mathrm{s}}(p_{\mathrm{Ti}},|\eta_{i}|)$, where $p_\mathrm{Ti}$ and $\eta_{i}$ are transverse momentum and $\eta$
of the subleading electron from a pair which fails selection. 
Similarly, the second term represents number of pairs where
leading electron fails signal selection while the subleading passes it. 
The last term corresponds to the case when both leading
and subleading electrons fail signal selection. This term has to be subtracted from the sum to correct for the double
counting of non-prompt electrons.

% TODO talk about systematics here:
To estimate systematic errors of the method one can test all assumptions made in the model and possible differences between the region used to derive 
fake factors and region where they will be applied. The following sources were considered:
\begin{itemize}
 \item the statistical uncertainty of the used data sample to derive fake factors.
 \item prompt MC subtraction, done to verify that there is no contamination from prompt leptons when deriving/applying fake factors.
 Due to the luminosity uncertainty of 2.8$\%$ and the uncertainty on MC cross section (7$\%$ on major prompt processes), prompt MC subtraction
 was varied for 10$\%$.
 \item requirement on away side jet $p_T$. It was varied up to 50 GeV in order to test dependence of the fake factor from faking jet kinematics.
 \item difference in the non-prompt background composition between data set used to derive fake factor and region where they were applied.
 Non-prompt background can originate from jets, which were created by gluons or light quarks, as well as from heavy flavour jets.
 Fake factor can depends from the proportion of this two category of jets in the region. That is why fake factors were derived separately
 for heavy and light flavour jets and difference between the results was taken as systematic error.
\end{itemize}
More detailed description of the evaluated systematics and the fake factor method overall can be found in~\cite{anthony_thesis}.

The electron fake factor as a function of electrons $E_\mathrm{T}$ with statistical and systematic errors are
shown in \FigureRef{fig:ff_e_errs}.
\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Electron fake factor $f$ as a function of electron $E_\mathrm{T}$. Combined statistical and systematic errors shown with error bars.}
\label{fig:ff_e_errs}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 
\toDo[say that fake factors were also measured not only for signal selection, but also for less strong selections
which are used for fake validation regions].
\toAsk[what fake CR says us? we use different fake factors for them then for signal, so there is no direct relation?]

Verification of the fake factor method is done with help of validation regions which are described further.




% The fake background includes all background processes where at least one of the leptons is fake. The dominant sources are $W$+jets and QCD multijets with smaller contributions arising from $Z$+jets and $t\bar{t}$. To assess this background, a data-driven method, known as the fake factor method, is employed. This method is used in several ATLAS analyses, particularly diboson measurements and searches\footnotemark. The method employed was covered in great depth in the previous 7 TeV incarnation of this analysis.

% \footnotetext{The following analyses, among others, use the fake factor method: SM $WW \ra \ell\nu\ell\nu$ and $WZ \ra \ell\nu\ell\ell$, $H \ra WW \ra \ell\nu\ell\nu$, and exotics $WZ \ra \ell\nu\ell\ell$ search.}

\section{Validation regions}

In order to make sure that all backgrounds are modelled/estimated correctly in the signal region one can define and use special validation regions.
These regions cantain same-sign lepton pairs and have to have kinematics close to the one in the signal region but should not overlap with it. 
Each region is designed to test one given background type at a time,
which means that in each control region only one background type has to give dominant contribution with comparison to all other backgrounds.

\subsection{Prompt opposite-sign dileptons}

First validation region is defined by using exactly the same event selection as for the same-sign signal region,
but requiring the two leptons to have opposite charge. 
This validation region is not testing any background specifically.
Overall normalization of the simulation to the data verify trigger and lepton reconstruction efficiencies.
While correct description of the Z peak shape in data by MC simulation tests electron scale momentum and resolution.
In \FigureRef{fig:OS_CR} invariant mass of opposite-sign electron pairs is shown.
In \TableRef{tab:dilep_isoOS} observed and expected number of the electron pair are shown as well.
Good agreement between data and simulation can be seen.

\subsection{Prompt same-sign dileptons}
% TODO table with final numbers to show how good MC normalization is wrt to data.

Same-sign dilepton prompt background originates dominantly from $WZ$ and $ZZ$ processes, where both Z and W bosons decays leptonicaly.
In order to check normalization of these processes prompt validation region is used.
In fully reconstructed event, where one of these processes took place, one can find at least one same-sign and one opposite-sign lepton pairs.
In order to enhance $WZ$ and $ZZ$ contributions to the validation region at least three leptons are required in the event, where one lepton pair
has to be same-sign electron pair and other one opposite-sign same-flavour pair (from $Z$ boson decay). 
Invariant mass of opposite-sign pair has to be close to $Z$ boson mass $(|m_{\Plepton\Plepton} - m_{Z}| < 10$ GeV$)$.

Expected and observed number of same-sign pairs in the control region are listed in \TableRef{tab:promptCR_yields}, 
and the ratios between data and expected pairs are collected in \TableRef{tab:prompt_ratios}. 
The expectations are in good agreement with data.

\subsection{Electron charge flip}
\toDo[describe plots...]

As described before events with opposite-sign lepton pairs can be reconstructed as same-sign lepton pairs if charge for one of leptons was wrongly reconstructed.
Misreconstraction probability is well modelled as function of $p_T$ in simulation 
but $\eta$-dependence have to be corrected by scale factors obtained with data-driven method.
One can make a sanity check, to cross check data from $Z$ peak region (same-sign pairs with invariant mass $80 < m_{ee} < 100$~GeV) with MC simulation corrected by the charge flip scale factors.

Invariant mass of the same-sign $Z$ peak is shown in \FigureRef{fig:charge_flip_CR_inv_mass}. 
Also $p_T$ and $\eta$ distribution for the leading electron are shown in \FigureRef{fig:charge_flip_CR_kinematics}.
A good agreement is observed which demonstrates work of charge lip scale factors.

Observed and expected number of lepton pairs are also shown in \TableRef{tab:ee_isoSS_Z} for combined $ee$ and separately for $e^{+}e^{+}$ and $e^{-}e^{-}$ pairs.

\subsection{Fake-enriched region}
To verify the fake factor method, a set of validation regions is checked. 
These regions have to be kinematically close as much as possible to
the nominal signal selection as well as looser signal selections, 
which is used to estimate non-prompt background with \EquationRef{eq:fake_pred}.

Looser signal selection have weaker isolation requirements and weaker 
electron identification requirement compared with nominal selection.
This is why two validation regions are used, one which is identical
to the nominal signal selection, except weaker isolation cut and another
one - except weaker identification requirement. 
Schematic representation of the signal and validation regions is shown
in \FigureRef{fig:fake_validation_regions}. 
% TODO
\toDo[explain here how fake factors for validation regions were calculated]
Looser selections for the
validation regions which were used for fake factor calculation are shown
as well. As can be seen from the picture, such design of the validation
region allows to test non-prompt estimation for signal region in the 
best way possible.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{center}
\end{figure}

In total, four different validation regions were defined for pairs of like-sign electrons.
One validation region consists from like-sign electron pairs, where both electrons pass the signal region isolation requirement, 
but fail ``tight'' electron identification requirement, while passing ``medium''.
Second validation region consists from like-sign electron pairs, where both electrons fails the signal isolation requirement
but pass a looser \textit{intermediate} isolation cut, which is loosened by 4 GeV, instead.
Third and fourt validation regions are identical for the second one but requires only leading (third region) or subleading (fourth region)
electron to fails the signal isolation requirement but pass a looser \textit{intermediate} isolation cut instead.

\FigureRef{fig:fakeCR_part1} and \FigureRef{fig:fakeCR_part2} show the invariant mass distributions for the validation regions. 
The agreement between observation and prediction is generally good.  
\TableRef{tab:ee_fakeCR} shows the expected and observed numbers of electron pairs. 
The uncertainties quoted are statistical only.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:ss_Systematics}


\toDo[some general words about importance of the systematics...]

Systematic uncertainties related to the data-driven methods for non-prompt and charge flip backgrounds estimation 
were described in \SectionRef{???} \toDo[] accordingly.

\subsection{Electron reconstruction}
Several systematic uncertainties are related to the electron reconstruction in the detector.
These uncertainties are provided by the ATLAS e/gamma working group which works on electron and photon identification performance of the ATLAS detector.
They provide recommendations and uncertainty estimations for all physics analyses which work with electron or photon final states.

Electron reconstruction and ``tight'' identification efficienies are obtained with tag-and-probe methods using
events with leptonic decays of $W$ and $Z$ bosons and $J/\psi$ mesons.
Reconstruction efficiency uncertainty range from 1.3-2.4\% depending on $\eta$, 
``tight'' identification efficiency uncertainty range from 2.0-2.8\% depending on both $E_\mathrm{T}$ and $\eta$~\cite{electron_reco_id_2011}.

The reconstruction of electron energies is optimised using multivariate algorithms.
Electron energy scale and energy resolution are obtained with the Z resonance peak.
Their uncertainies are provided as function of $E_\mathrm{T}$ and $\eta$~\cite{electron_energy_errors_Run1} 
by working group as well.

All these uncertainties are grouped togeter under the name ``Electron reconstruction ans identification'' in \TableRef{tab:syst}.

\subsection{Trigger and luminosity}
Efficiency of trigger for electrons with different $p_T$ and $\eta$ have some uncertainty as well.
This uncertainty is estimated to be at $\sim1\%$ level by the ATLAS trigger groups.
The resulting uncertainty on the yield in the signal region is different, since there are two leptons that can pass the trigger requirement. 

To scale background prediction obtained with MC simulation to the data 
one need to know integrated luminosity of the collected data sample. 
That is why luminosity uncetainty propagates to all backgrounds measured from MC simulation.
The integrated luminosity uncertainty in 2012 is equal to 2.8$\%$~\cite{Aad:2013ucp} 
and it was obtained in similar way as described in \SectionRef{sec:lucid_performance}.

\subsection{Statistics and theoretical cross section}
Limited number of simulated events in the Monte Carlo samples lead to an additional uncertainty which is listed as ``MC statistics'' in \TableRef{tab:syst}.
This uncertainty also include effect of the limited number of events in data sets used in data-driven methods to measure charge flip rate and fake factor.
Statistical uncertainty give significant contribution for high-mass bins.

As one can see from \TableRef{tab:MC_cross} different processes were simulated with using different MC generators, PDF sets and normalization.
Additional uncertainty arises from choices of latter.
To estimate these uncertainties different MC generators, parton shower and hadronization models are tested.
Uncertainty on PDF and strong coupling constant $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ are estimated by using different PDF sets following recommendations from~\cite{pdf4lhc}.
Also renormalisation and factorisation scales are varied by factor of two to estimate an effect on total cross section of the processes.
Summary list of uncertainties used in the analysis in shown in \TableRef{tab:systematics_common}.
Detailed information about cross section calculations and its errors for some processes 
are reported in~\cite{diboson_cross_section,ttW_cross_section,ttV_cross_section}.

\section{Signal Region}
\label{sec:ss_signalRegion}

Same-sign lepton pair invariant mass in the signal region is shown in~\FigureRef{fig:signal_mass}.
The last bin in the histogram is an overflow bin, which include number of pairs with invariant mass higher than 600 GeV.
Observed number of pairs is compatible with predicted background.
As one can see the dominant background arises from charge flip component.
Predicted contribution from each background process with different invariant mass cuts are shown in \TableRef{tab:2iso_ee_SS}.
In \FigureRef{fig:signal_kinematics} kinematics of the leading lepton is shown. 
In \FigureRef{fig:delta_phi} angle between same-sign electrons in the pair is shown as well.
Background prediction reasonably describes all these distributions within uncertainties bands.

\subsection{Limit setting}

Background prediction describes data very well and there is no visible significant deviations which can indicate to potential presence of the BSM signal.
The idea of this analysis was to be as general as possible and to perform a search for the a new physics without favoring any BSM model.
This is why next step is to calculate an exclusion limits on the new physics with same-sign lepton pairs.

Due to limited acceptance of the detector signal region was design to use most efficient phase space possible.
This is why cross section of the process relates with measured cross section in the signal region or the so-called fiducial cross section as:
\begin{equation}
 \sigma = \dfrac{\sigma^{fid}}{<N_{pair}>A}
 \label{eq:cross_section}
\end{equation}
where $<N_{pair}>$ is average number of same-sign pairs produced per event and $A$ is the fiducial acceptance (or volume).
Definition of fiducial volume is discussed in \SectionRef{subsec:fid_volume_eff}.

The cross section limits are derived with using a $CLs$~\cite{CLs_tecnique,CLs_2} prescription with help of RooStat~\cite{RooStat_project} framework 
provided by the ATLAS Statistics Committee. $CLs$ method state that the signal hypothesis is excluded at the confidence level $CL$ when
\begin{equation}
 1 - CL_s \leq CL
\end{equation}
where $CL_s$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
 CL_s \equiv \dfrac{CL_{s+b}}{CL_b}
\end{equation}
where $CL_b$ is a confidence level observed for the background only hypothesis and $CL_{s+b}$ - for background plus signal hypothesis.
Practically $CL_b$ ($CL_{s+b}$) is probability for finding the oberved data given an expected background (background plus signal).
This probability is a Poisson distributed probabilities calculated based on number of observed and expeted same-sign electron pairs in the signal region.
A used test-statistics for the limits is a the log likelihood ratio.
\toAsk[is it correct to say like this?] Systematic uncertainties and correlations between them are taken into account.
For example, the charge-flip scale factor uncertainty is correlated among Drell-Yan, $t\bar{t}$, $WW$ and $W\gamma$.
Experimental errors such as electron reco, ID, trigger, energy as listed in are treated as one uncertainty and correlated among all expected backgrounds and Signal.
MC cross section errors are independent except for dibosons ($ZZ$, $WZ$ and $WW$).
The luminosity is common to all, so it is naturally correlated.
Statistical errors are all independent.

Following this prescription and using number of expected and observed same-sign lepton pairs one can compute 
an upper limits at the certain confidence level (typically in 95$\%$ level) on the number of same-sign lepton pairs ($N_{95}$)
contributed by the new physics beyond the SM. Limits can be set for different invariant mass thresholds, because it is main observable for the analysis.
These limits can be translated to the upper limits on fidicual cross section as:
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_{95}^{fid} = \dfrac{N_{95}}{\epsilon_{fid} \times \int \mathscr{L} dt}
 \label{eq:fid_cross_section}
\end{equation}
where $\int \mathscr{L} dt$ is an integrated luminosity of the data and $\epsilon_{fid}$ is a fiducial efficiency for finding a same-sign electron pair from
a possible signal from new physics in the fiducial volume, which is described in \SectionRef{subsec:fid_volume_eff}.

% TODO explain fiducial efficiency

\subsection{Fiducial volume and fiducial efficiency}
\label{subsec:fid_volume_eff}

As can be seen from \EquationRef{eq:cross_section} and \EquationRef{eq:fid_cross_section} in order to translate from number of measured and expted lepton pairs 
to the cross section of the potential BSM signal one need to know fiducial volume and efficiency.
The reason is that detector is not 100$\%$ efficient to reconstruct leptons as well as it does not cover the whole phase space around the interaction point.
Fiducial volume represent the phase space region that is truncated in a manner that mimics detector acceptance.
It is defined by set of cuts on truth (generator) level. 
Kinematic cuts on the electrons are identical to the one used in the signal region definition on reconstruction level:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Leading electron $p_T > 25$ GeV
 \item Subleading electron $p_T > 20$ GeV
 \item $|\eta|<1.37$ or $1.52<|\eta|<2.47$
\end{itemize}
Requirements on the electron pair are the same as well:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Same-sign pair with $m_{ee} > 15$ GeV
 \item Veto pairs with $70 < m_{ee} < 110$ GeV
 \item No opposite-sign same-flavour pairs with $|m_{ee} - m_{Z}| < 10$ GeV
\end{itemize}
Since electrons are required to be isolated on reconstruction level, isolation also has to be applied on the truth level as well.
Track-based isolation are identical as on reconstruction level:
all charged particles within the cone $\Delta R < 0.3$ around the electron with $p_T > 0.4$ GeV are considered and
sum of their $p_T$ has to be not larger than 10$\%$ of the electron $p_T$.
Calorimeter-based isolation was not applied on the truth level due to significantly different behaviour on reconstruction and truth levels.

As one can see cuts on truth level are identical to one used in reconstruction level.
In case of the ideal detector fiducial volume would completely correspond to the geometrical detector acceptance.
Because the real detector does not provide 100$\%$ reconstruction efficiency in order to relate fiducial volume with real geometrical detector acceptance
a fidducial efficiency is used, which is defined as:
\begin{equation}
 \epsilon_{fid} = \dfrac{N_r}{N_f}
\end{equation}
where $N_f$ is number of electron pair which passed fiducial volume cuts on truth level and $N_r$ - passed fiducial volume cuts on truth level 
as well as all signal selection cuts on reconstruction level.

In order to perform a search for new physics in the model independent way one want fiducial efficiency to be constant and does not depend on the type of the BSM model.
However, different models provides different $p_T$ and $\eta$ spectrums and electron reconstruction efficieny dependce both from $p_T$ and $\eta$.
As reported in~\cite{electron_tight} efficiency can vary up to 15$\%$ for ``tight'' identification criterea with respect to electron $p_T$.
Also presence and number of the jets in the final state, which is model dependent, affects electron isolation efficiency, which will have an effect on 
fiducial efficiency as well.

In order to estimate value of the fiducial efficiency four different BSM models were considered:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Double charged Higgs. This model assume production of two doubly charged scalar bosons which, decaying leptonically, will provide two pair of same-sign leptons.
 No jets in the final state. A range of 100-1000 GeV of double charged Higgs were considered.
 \item Colored Zee-Babu model. It assumes production of the diquark, which decays to two leptoquark with the same charge, 
 which in their turn decay to lepton and quark. Final state consist from one same-sign lepton pair plus two jets.
 Masses considered in the model were 2.5-3.5 TeV for diquark and 1-1.4 TeV for leptoquarks.
 \item Production of heavy right-handed $W_R$ boson and heavy Majorana neutrino. $W_R$ decays to lepton and Majorana neutrino, 
 which decays to $W$ boson and another lepton. Final state consist from one same-sign pair and products of the W boson decay.
 Mass of $W_R$ was between 1 TeV and 2 TeV, while mass of Majorana neutrino was in range 0.25-1.5 TeV
 \item Pair production of forth generation down-type quark. Both quarks semi-leptoncally decay to $t$ quark and then to $b$ quarks.
 Final state consist from two jets plus four W bosons. At least two same-sign bosons have to decay leptonically in order to provide a same-sign lepton pair.
 This state is charachterized by large hadron activity due to high jet multiplicity.
 Mass of forth generation quark was varied from 400 GeV to 1 TeV.
\end{itemize}
Fiducial efficiencies for these model were calculated with different dilepton mass thresholds.
Obtained efficiencies are in range 48-74$\%$. The lowest efficiency were given by forth generation down-type quark, while the highest one 
for heavy right-handed $W_R$ boson and heavy Majorana neutrino. Latter model had larger efficiency with respect to doubly charged Higgs model
because final state of doubly charged Higgs model contains two same-sign pairs against one pair in Majorana model.
Efficiencies were measured separately for positive and negative same-sign pairs separately but no significant difference were observed.

To provide conservate cross section limit setting for new physics beyond the SM the lowest obtained efficiency, which was 48.3$\%$, have been decided to be used.

\toAsk[why do we need calorimeter-based isolation? Because it helps to reduce pile-up dependence?]

\subsection{Fiducial cross section limits}

of the new physics beyond the SM for different invariant mass thresholds based on the values from \TableRef{tab:2iso_ee_SS}

\section{Mass limits on doubly charged Higgs}
As an example of the BSM model which produce same-sing lepton pairs in the final state, a double charged Higgs bosons were studied.
The search strategy are the same as described above.
Since final state of this model is two same-sign pair of leptons without any jet activity or presense of missing transverse energy 
there is no need to optimize signal selection.
Double charged Higgs decay is reconstructed as a sharp peak in the dilepton invariant mass.
This is why using fiducial efficiency calculated in bins of 100 GeV is not optimal from point of view signal sensetivity.
Thus search is performed in mass bins with mass dependent width.

\subsection{MC simulation}
A few samples were generated with Pythia8~\cite{???} which correspond to the different mass of the left-handed and right-handed douly charged Higgs.
Simulated masses were in range 50-600 GeV in steps of 50 GeV and one sample with 1 TeV mass.
Kinematics of the left-handed and right-handed Higgs bosons are identical, but production rate is different due to different coupling constant to Z boson mediator~\cite{dch_note}.
Cross sections are known with NLO precision.

\subsection{Model acceptance and efficiency}
The width of double charged Higgs decay is dominated by the momentum resolution of the electrons.
Because widths become larger with invariant mass search was performed in the mass bins with variable width.
The idea behind mass bin widths optimization lay in two facts. From one side, a mass bin have to cover most part of the signal
but from otherside, background contribution in the mass bin is desired to be as small as possible.
To satisfy both conditions signal significance, $S$, was chosen as optimization criteria:
\begin{equation}
 S = \sqrt{ 2((s+B)ln(1+s/B)-s } 
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the expected signal and $B=b+\delta b^2$ is the predicted background plus background systematics squared.
A bin width is parametrized as a second-order polinom of the Higgs mass.
Cofficients of the polinom were parameters to optimize.
During the optimization procedre it become clear that there is a third factor which have to be taken into account.
Due to limited statistics of the predicted background one cannot have too many mass bins otherwise cross section
exlusion limit will fluctuate very much from bin to bin. 
The optimal bin width parametrization was found to be $\pm(0.04 \times m(\dch) + 0.2 \cdot 10^{-4} \times m(\dch)^{2})$,
where $m(\dch)$ is the Higgs mass.

Next step is to define how many lepton pairs produced from Higgs boson decays are reconstructed, selected and fall into appropriate mass bin.
Number of generated Higgs boson is known this is why one need only count number of reconstructed same-sign pairs which fall into appropriate mass bins.
The ratio of reconstructed pairs to the total number of generated correscpond to the total efficiency which includes acceptance and selection eficiency.
Efficienies for each mass points were calculated but in order to interpolate between the simulated mass points, total efficiency, $\varepsilon_{tot}$, is fitted by
an empiricalpiecewise function:
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{tot}(m) = \begin{cases} p_{0} (1-e^{-(m-p_{1})/p_{2}}), & \mbox{if } m < 450\mbox{ GeV} \\ 
p_{3} + p_{4} m, & \mbox{if } m \geq 450\mbox{ GeV} \end{cases}
\label{eq:ee_eff}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is Higgs mass and $p_{0}, p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}$ are fit parameters which values are shown in \TableRef{tab:ee_eff_params}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \caption{Fitted parameter values for Equation~\ref{eq:ee_eff}, which gives $\varepsilon_{tot}(m)$.}

\end{figure}

Upper cross section limit on pair production of doubly charged Higgs are set in the same way as limits on new physics described earlier.
A cross section is determined as:
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_{HH}\times BR =\frac{N_{H}^{rec}}{2\times A\times \epsilon \times \int \mathscr{L} dt}
\end{equation}
where BR is branching ratio of $H^{\pm\pm} \to e^{\pm}e^{\pm}$ decay, $N_{H}^{rec}$ is number of reconstructed $H^{\pm\pm}$, $A\times \epsilon$ is total efficiency described earlier and
$\int \mathscr{L} dt$ is integrated luminosity.
Factor 2 in the denominator is present to take into account presence of two same-sign pairs from $H^{++}$ and $H^{--}$ in the event.

Upper cross section limit times branching ratio (which is assumed to be 100$\%$) at 95$\%$ CL is shown in \FigureRef{fig:dch_limits_mass}.
The scatter between mass bins are caused by fluctuations of the predicted background due to low statistics in bins.
A good agreement between expected and observed limit lines are observed and all diviations lay within $2\sigma$.
The theoretical cross section curves as a function of Higgs mass for left- and right-handed doubly charged Higgs bosons 
are shown as well.
Lower mass limits of the model correspond to intersaction of the theoretical curve with expected cross section curve.
Mass limits are summarized in the \TableRef{tab:limits_mass}.
