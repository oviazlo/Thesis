% ******************************************************************************

Despite a great success of the Standard Model (SM) in describing interactions of the elementary particles, there is a plethora of phenomena
which cannot be explained by the SM. Gravity, Dark Energy and Matter, neutrino masses and other observations are not predicted by the
SM, which indicates its incompleteness.
This is why many studies at LHC experiments are focused on probing new energy regimes to search for new physics, 
observation of which can prove or deny validity of different extensions of the SM.

Many beyond the Standard Model (BSM) models predict a same-sign dilepton production, which is a very distinctive final state.
Also it is a very clean signal due to the very few SM processes, which predict such a final state.
This leads to high new physics sensitivity.

\toAsk[some more ATLAS 8 TeV papers with same-sign leptons?]

There is a number of searches in ATLAS which target same-sign dilepton final state signature with 
additional requirements on number of jets or missing transverse energy~\cite{heavy_majorana_neutrino_paper,floderus_paper,Aad:2014pda}.
Current analysis aims to be as inclusive as possible and to probe exclusively the same-sign dilepton signature and
all the BSM models which predict it.

For this purpose signal selection is based on the minimal kinematic requirements on leptons.
Electron is a very clean object which can be precisely reconstructed with high efficiency in ATLAS.
The search observable for the analysis was chosen to be the same-sign dilepton invariant mass.

If no signal from new physics is found, an upper limit on fiducial cross section for new physics can be set.
As an example of a BSM model with the same-sign dilepton final state, a pair production of a doubly charged Higgs bosons
will be studied in detail within current search.

The analysis uses three dilepton channels: $e^{\pm}e^{\pm}$, $\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}$ and $e^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}$.
This chapter will describe search only with the $e^{\pm}e^{\pm}$ channel.

\section{Background processes}
\label{sec:wprimeBackgrounds}
% ******************************************************************************
% TODO
% - describe that there are hree possibilities to reconstruct same-sign lepton pair
% - 
% ******************************************************************************

There are four different components which contribute to the signal region.
The first component is the so called prompt background which corresponds to prompt same-sign dileptons originating from the SM processes.
Just a few SM processes have same-sign dileptons in the final state. In such processes same-sign leptons originate from semileptonic decays of top quarks
and/or leptonic decays of $W$ or $Z$ bosons. Some example of corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in \FigureRef{fig:prompt_bkg_feynman_diag}.
In general, SM processes with the same-sign dilepton final state have relatively small cross sections.

The second component comes from the wrong reconstruction of the lepton itself, when a pion or a jet is reconstructed as a lepton, or from leptons which were produced 
not in the pp collision but from decays of secondary particles, e.g. kaons. This component is called non-prompt or fake background.

% TODO add trident event Feynman diagram
The third component comes from the misidentification of the electrical charge of the lepton, which makes processes where opposite-sign lepton pair is produced 
contributing to the signal selection as well. The charge misidentification effect becomes significant for high-momentum leptons, when curvature of the track 
is hard to reconstruct. 
This component also includes events where a prompt electron emits a photon due to bremsstrahlung, which in its turn creates an electron-positron pair.
One lepton from the pair can form a same-sign electron pair with the original prompt lepton. These two processes are referred to as charge misidentification or
charge flip background later in the text.

The last component originates from $W\gamma$ processes, where an electron-positron pair is created from photon conversion, and by combining with an electron from $W$ decay
a same-sign lepton pair can be formed. It is considered separately from the charge flip background because it does not contain prompt opposite-sign electron pairs.

% TODO describe connection of written above with table with all used MC samples...
% TODO normalization is just checked for it is not applied as a scale factor. Cross check with Monika!!!
Prompt background is modelled by the MC simulation. 
% with applying the overall normalization of the MC samples to the data in the control region.
Non-prompt background is derived using a data-driven method, the so-called fake factor method.
Charge flip and $W\gamma$ backgrounds are estimated from the MC simulation plus are corrected by the charge flip scale factor, derived in a data-driven way.

The list of all the MC samples used in the analysis is shown in \TableRef{tab:MC_cross}. 
All listed samples were centrally produced by ATLAS working groups.
All other processes which are not listed in the table don't contribute
significantly to the same-sign signal region and are considered negligible.
This table summarizes which MC generators and parton distribution function (PDF) sets were used, and order of cross section calculations.

\section{Event selection}
% TODO mention here about size of the dataset and that it was 8 TeV 50 ns data.
% TODO description of the used triggers here!
% TODO [no jet selection is described]

The analysis is based on the pp collision data collected in 2012 by the ATLAS detector with 8 TeV center of mass energy.
Integrated luminosity of the sample correspond to 20.3 fb$^{-1}$, the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing was equal to 21.

An event selected for the analysis should have at least one reconstructed vertex with at least three tracks matched to it. 
If there are several vertices, the one with the highest
$\sum p^2_T$, where $p_T$ are transverse momenta of the matched tracks, is chosen.
Events should have at least two electron candidates, which is provided by selecting only events
which fire dilepton trigger, which requires presence of two electrons with $p_T > 12$ GeV.
In order to exclude ambiguities between electron and jet reconstruction, the electrons are required to
be isolated. Isolation is calculated by summing up activity around the electron candidate within a defined cone size, 
$\Delta R = \sqrt{ (\eta_e-\eta_i)^2 + (\phi_e-\phi_i)^2 }$,
where $\eta_e$ and $\phi_e$ are rapidity and azimuthal angle of the electron candidate and $\eta_i$ and $\phi_i$ are rapidity and azimuthal angle of track or calorimeter cluster, not related to the electron candidate. Detailed explanations of the isolation and other requirements on electron candidates are given further in the text.

\subsection{Electron selection}
\label{subsec:electron_selection}
Next step in the selection is to select isolated high-$p_T$ electrons present in the event.
Electron reconstruction in the ATLAS detector central region ($\eta<2.5$) is done by matching tracks from inner detector with energy deposits in the EM calorimeter.
The spatial resolution of the electron candidate in ($\eta$,$\phi$) plane are taken from the parameters of the matched track,
while energy is calculated from energy deposits in the EM calorimeter.

% ATLAS use three sets of electron identification criteria, which are ordered by background-rejection power and identification efficiency~\cite{electron_tight}.
% These sets are labelled as loose, medium and tight. Loose set provide has poor background-rejection power while tight - has the best.
% But background-rejection power comes at cost of identification efficiency

% so as to provide increasing
% background-rejection power at some cost to the identi-fication efficiency. 


Electrons of interest are good reconstructed candidates, tracks of which originate from the primary vertex. To select such candidates, 
the following requirements have to be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $p_T > 20$ GeV: to ensure a high and flat trigger efficiency and to harmonize $p_T$ requirement between three analysis channels ($ee$, $\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$) 
 \item $|\eta|<2.47$: to be within high-granularity acceptance of the EM calorimeter, but excluding barrel-end-cap transition region $1.37<|\eta|<1.52$.
 \item Transverse and longitudinal impact parameters $|d_0|/\sigma(d_0) < 3$ and $|z_0 \times sin \theta| < 1$ mm: 
 to verify that the electron was produced close to the primary vertex and to reject electrons originating from decays of long-lived particles.
 \item To pass ``tight'' electron set of identification criteria defined in~\cite{electron_tight}. \\ 
 This set provide the best background-rejection efficiency, a factor of two with respect to the medium selection, 
 at cost of slightly smaller identification efficiency, less than 10$\%$ with respect to the medium selection.
 \item To pass isolation requirement: to distinguish prompt electrons from those associated with jet activity.
 \item No reconstructed jet within $\Delta R < 0.4$: to remove ambiguous classification of the track, 
 when track is classified as an electron and as a jet simultaneously,
 or when a jet is too close to the electron, leading to poor reconstruction of the latter. 
\end{itemize}

The isolation requirement was chosen in order to reach pile-up independent efficiency of more than 99$\%$ for electrons 
with $p_T >$ 40 GeV. The requirement has two parts.
Firstly, the sum of the transverse energies in the EM and hadronic calorimeters around the electron within 
$\Delta R < 0.2$, with core electron energy subtracted from the sum, has to be less than 
3 GeV $+ (p_T - 20$ GeV$) \times 0.037$, where $p_T$ is electron transverse momentum.
Secondly, the sum of $p_T$ of all tracks with $p_T > 0.4$ GeV within $\Delta R < 0.3$ around the the electron track has
to be less than 10$\%$ of electron $p_T$.

Electrons used in validation regions, used for validation of the background estimation, 
are required to fail one or several requirements above but pass looser one, as will be described further in the text.

\subsection{Definition of same-sign electron pair}
% TODO inv. mass cut; treatment of event with three leptons;
All the electrons which passed the selection are considered while forming lepton pairs.
All combinations are checked, and it is allowed to have more than one pair selected in one event.
Electrons in the pair are classified by the $p_T$: electron with a higher $p_T$ is called leading lepton, while another one with lower $p_T$ - subleading lepton.
The leading lepton has to pass a more strict cut $p_T>25$ GeV while the subleading lepton has to satisfy $p_T>20$ GeV as described above.

If an event contains an opposite-sign same flavour lepton pair which satisfies condition $( |m_{\Plepton\Plepton} - m_{Z}| < 10$ GeV$)$,
where $m_{\Plepton\Plepton}$ is the lepton pair invariant mass and $m_{Z}$ is the mass of Z boson, the entire event is discarded.
This significantly suppresses prompt background contribution.

To avoid low-mass hadronic resonances like $J/\psi$ or $\varUpsilon$ to show up in the invariant mass spectrum, 
only same-sign pairs with $m_{\Plepton\Plepton}>15$ GeV are selected.
Additionally, if same-sign lepton pairs with the invariant mass $70 < m_{\Plepton\Plepton}< 110$ GeV, 
which corresponds to the Z peak region, are found in the event, such event is removed.
This region is used for estimation of the electron charge misidentification background, as described further.

\section{Estimation of the charge flip and non-prompt backgrounds}

\subsection{Prompt opposite-sign dilepton with charge flip}
\label{subsec:CF_definition}
% TODO
% subsection flow:
% CF sources --> method and used regions --> validation of the method --> deriving scale factors --> appling to specific MC samples

% \toAsk[why we define CF rate in 80..100 GeV region, while we cut 70..110 GeV from signal region?]
% \toAsk[CF at high pT. extrapolation? of one large bin with huge error? look it up!]

Since the charge of one of the reconstructed electrons from the pair can be misidentified, 
processes with opposite-sign dilepton final state can contribute to the signal region.
Because the prompt background is relatively small in the signal region, a possibility of a charge flip cannot be neglected and has to be properly estimated. 
Two cases are considered as a charge flip background. 
The first one is when the electron charge is truly misidentified due to matching of the wrong track to the EM cluster 
or due to a small curvature of the high-momentum track. 
The second one is when an electron emits a photon by bremsstrahlung, which in its turn decays to an electron-positron pair. 
Instead of the original electron, an electron from the photon decay can be attributed to the pair and can have an opposite charge.

In order to estimate how many events with opposite-sign dileptons will ``leak'' to the same-sign dilepton signal region, 
one has to know the electron charge flip rate. It is expected that the charge flip depends on the electron momentum (due to the track curvature) 
and on $\eta$ (due to the different amount of material in the detector versus $\eta$).

Electrons from Z boson decays provide a huge sample of opposite-sign lepton pairs which can be used to estimate the charge flip rate. 
By applying signal selection
and requiring the invariant mass of the lepton pair to be around Z mass, $80 < m_{ee} < 100$ GeV, one obtains a pure
sample of electron pairs, where charge of one electron is flipped. Knowing the number of opposite-sign pairs which pass signal selection, 
one can extract the charge flip rate.

In \FigureRef{fig:chargeFlip_structure} charge flip rate obtained from MC simulation as a function of $p_T$ is shown.
By using information on truth (generated) level one can distinguish charge flip due to photon conversion from other effects which is shown in the figure.
Contribution from photon conversion from the bremsstrahlung process dominates 
the total charge flip rate over entire $p_T$ range except of the high-$p_T$ region, where misidentification 
of charge due to very small curvature of tracks becomes dominant.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{SS/support_note/chargeflip/misidratept_ZDY.eps}
\caption{Electron charge misidentification rate, obtained from MC simulation using electrons from Z boson decay. 
Contribution from charge flip due to photon conversion is shown separately on the plot and as a fraction of the total rate in the ratio plot below.}
\label{fig:chargeFlip_structure}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To verify MC estimation of the charge flip, a special data-driven technique, the so-called likelihood method, 
is used in the same way as in ref.~\cite{same_sign_paper_7tev}.
This method is based on using a maximum likelihood fit to extract the charge flip rates in different kinematic regions simultaneously~\cite{cf_top_paper}.
This method is found to be the most precise due to using most statistics available and providing kinematically unbiased results~\cite{anthony_thesis} 
for same-sign dilepton analysis with 7 TeV data.

To cross-check applicability of the method, it was first used on 
the MC simulation, and charge flip rates were compared with the ones from the generator level (truth) information. 

The comparison demonstrates that the likelihood method provides a very reliable result as shown in
\FigureRef{fig:likelihood_cross_check}.

Ratio between the rate obtained with the likelihood method to the rate obtained with truth MC information is shown below in the ratio plot. }
\label{fig:likelihood_cross_check}
\end{figure}

Charge flip rate as a function of $p_T$ and $\eta$ is shown in \FigureRef{fig:charge_flip_data_vs_mc}.
Comparisons between MC simulation and likelihood data-driven predictions are shown. 
Dependence of the rate on $p_T$ is well described by MC simulation, while some difference is observed
in high-$\eta$ region. This is why $\eta$-dependent scale factors were calculated as a ratio of the charge flip rate extracted from collision date 
to the rate predicted by the MC simulation.

\label{fig:charge_flip_data_vs_mc}
\end{figure}

The charge flip background consists of opposite-sign lepton pairs which were reconstructed as same-sign pairs.
The background is estimated from MC simulation (all the considered processes are shown in the lower part of the \TableRef{tab:MC_cross}) 
plus is corrected by a charge flip scale factor to properly reproduce $\eta$-dependence of the charge flip rate.

To estimate the systematic error of the derived scale factors, the following uncertainty sources were considered:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The width of the invariant mass window, used to preselect electrons from the $Z$ peak, was varied by 10 GeV.
 The largest difference between the nominal scale factors and scale factor obtained from $Z$ peak window width variation was taken as a systematic error.
 \item The electron isolation requirement was loosened by 4 GeV in both track- and calorimeter-based isolation criteria.
\end{itemize}
Electrons from Z decays have a limited $p_T$-range of up to around 100 GeV. As can be seen in~\FigureRef{fig:charge_flip_data_vs_mc} (right), 
MC simulation describes $p_T$ dependence of the charge flip rate very well, thus it was decided to rely on MC simulation 
for the high-$p_T$ leptons. Additional studies were done to estimate systematic uncertainty in this case.
Special MC samples with varied detector alignment and amount of detector material (with 5-20$\%$ of variations depending on the sub-detector) 
were used in order to estimate an effect on the charge flip rate.
A conservative estimate of a 20$\%$ error was assigned to the high-$p_T$ lepton charge flip rate.

The total systematic uncertainty of the background prediction is shown in~\TableRef{tab:syst}.

The charge flip scale factor are also applied for the MC prediction of the background from $W\gamma$ process as well.
\toAsk[should I say smth. more about $W\gamma$ process]

\subsection{Non-prompt background}
\label{subsec:fakes_description}
Another type of background present after the signal selection is the so-called non-prompt background.
Main sources of this background are jets misidentified as electrons and electrons which do not originate from 
the primary vertex, e.g. electrons from semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavor quarks ($b$, $c$).
To estimate this background a data-driven method, the so-called fake factor method, is used.

The first step of the methods is to define a background region, which does not overlap with the signal region, where 
contribution of non-prompt electrons is dominant, while contribution from prompt electrons is as small as possible.
It must contain strictly one reconstructed electron (probably a jet misreconstructed as electron) with $p_T > 20$ GeV.
To counterbalance the electron, a jet in the opposite azimuthal direction ($\Delta \phi (e,jet) > 2.4$) is required.
By requiring strictly one electron one can make sure that the background region will not overlap with the signal selection and processes 
like Drell-Yan and \ttbar~will be suppressed.
To make sure that the opposite side jet and the non-prompt electron are well balanced in terms of energy, such jet is
requested to have $p_T > 30$ GeV.
To suppress contribution from W boson production processes, a requirement on transverse invariant mass 
$m_\mathrm{T}$
\footnote{$m_\mathrm{T} = \sqrt{2 p_\mathrm{T} p_T^{miss} (1-\cos\varphi_{\Plepton\nu})}$, where
$p_\mathrm{T}$ is the transverse momentum of the electron, $p_T^{miss}$ is the transverse missing energy of the event
and $\varphi_{\Plepton\nu}$ is the angle in transverse plane between electron direction and direction of the missing energy.}
$ > 40$ GeV is applied.

In this background region one define a fake factor $f$ as:
\begin{equation}
f = \frac{N_{\mathrm{P}} - N_{\mathrm{P}}^{\mathrm{prompt}}}{N_{\mathrm{F}}  - N_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{prompt}}}
\label{eq:fakefactor}
\end{equation}
where $N_{\mathrm{P}}$ is the number of reconstructed electrons in the background region which pass the electron signal selection,
described above in \SectionRef{subsec:electron_selection}, and $N_{\mathrm{F}}$ is the number of electrons which do not meet 
signal electron selection requirements but satisfy a looser selection. Looser selection is identical to that for the signal, except 
the requirement that the electron has to satisfy ``medium'' set of electron identification criteria~\cite{electron_tight} instead of ``tight'',
and it has to fail the calorimeter- or track-based isolation criterion, or both.
$N_{\mathrm{P}}^{\mathrm{prompt}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{prompt}}$ are numbers of real prompt
leptons, obtained from MC simulation, which pass signal and looser selections respectively.
Contribution of prompt leptons has to be subtracted in order to make sure that 
the fake factor is evaluated as ratio of non-prompt electrons that passed the signal selection to
the number of non-prompt electrons that passed the looser selection and there is no contamination from real prompt leptons.
When the fake factor has been measured in the background region it can be used to predict the non-prompt background in the signal region.
In order to take into account possible different kinematics of a lepton in the region were the fake factor was derived 
and the region were it will be applied, the fake factor is measured as a function of electrons $p_T$ and $\eta$.
The total number of the non-prompt same-sign pairs, $N_{\mathrm{NP}}$, in the signal region can be estimated as:
\begin{equation}
N_{\mathrm{NP}} = \sum_{i}^{\mathrm{N_{P_l F_s}}} f_{\mathrm{s}}(p_{\mathrm{Ti}},|\eta_{i}|) + \sum_{i}^{\mathrm{N_{F_l P_s}}} f_{\mathrm{l}}(p_{\mathrm{T}i},|\eta_{i}|) - \sum_{i}^{\mathrm{N_{F_l F_s}}} f_{\mathrm{l}}(p_{\mathrm{T}i},|\eta_{i}|) \times f_{\mathrm{s}}(p_{\mathrm{T}i},|\eta_{i}|)
\label{eq:fake_pred}
\end{equation}
where the first term corresponds to the number of electron pairs ($N_{P_l F_s}$) 
where the leading electron (denoted by ``l'') passes selection criteria ($P_l$) and the subleading electron 
(denoted by ``s'')
fails to fulfill it ($F_s$), but passes the looser selection used for the fake factor calculation. 
Contribution of every such pair to the signal region is scaled by the fake factor 
$f_{\mathrm{s}}(p_{\mathrm{Ti}},|\eta_{i}|)$, where $p_\mathrm{Ti}$ and $\eta_{i}$ are transverse momentum and pseudorapidity
of the subleading electron of a pair which fails the signal selection. 
Similarly, the second term represents the number of pairs where
the leading electron fails signal selection while the subleading one passes it. 
The last term corresponds to the case when both leading
and subleading electrons fail signal selection. This term has to be subtracted from the sum to correct for the double
counting of non-prompt electron pairs.

To estimate systematic errors of the method one can test all the assumptions made in the method and take into account possible differences between 
the region used to derive fake factors, and the region where they will be applied. The following sources were considered:
\begin{itemize}
 \item statistical uncertainty of the data sample used to derive fake factors;
 \item prompt MC subtraction, which is done to verify that there is no contamination from prompt leptons when deriving/applying fake factors.
 Due to the luminosity uncertainty of 2.8$\%$ and the uncertainty of MC cross section (7$\%$ on major prompt processes), prompt MC subtraction
 was varied by 10$\%$;
 \item requirement on away side jet $p_T$. It was varied up to 50 GeV in order to test dependence of the fake factor on faking jet kinematics;
 \item difference in the non-prompt background composition in the region used to derive the fake factors and the region where they were applied.
 Non-prompt background can originate from jets, which were created by gluons or light quarks, as well as from heavy flavour jets.
 Fake factor depends on the proportion of these two categories of jets in the region. This is why fake factors were derived separately
 for heavy and light flavour jets, and the difference between the results was taken as systematic error.
\end{itemize}
More detailed description of the evaluated systematic uncertainties and the fake factor method overall can be found in~\cite{anthony_thesis}.

The electron fake factor as a function of electron $p_T$ with statistical and systematic errors is
shown in \FigureRef{fig:ff_e_errs}.

\end{figure} 
% TODO[say that fake factors were also measured not only for signal selection, but also for less strong selections which are used for fake validation regions].

Verification of the fake factor method is done with the help of validation regions which are described further.

% The fake background includes all background processes where at least one of the leptons is fake. The dominant sources are $W$+jets and QCD multijets with smaller contributions arising from $Z$+jets and $t\bar{t}$. To assess this background, a data-driven method, known as the fake factor method, is employed. This method is used in several ATLAS analyses, particularly diboson measurements and searches\footnotemark. The method employed was covered in great depth in the previous 7 TeV incarnation of this analysis.

% \footnotetext{The following analyses, among others, use the fake factor method: SM $WW \ra \ell\nu\ell\nu$ and $WZ \ra \ell\nu\ell\ell$, $H \ra WW \ra \ell\nu\ell\nu$, and exotics $WZ \ra \ell\nu\ell\ell$ search.}

\section{Background validation regions}

In order to make sure that all backgrounds are modelled/predicted correctly in the signal region, one can define and use special validation regions.
These regions should be kinematically close to the signal region but should not overlap with it. 
Each region is designed to test one given background type at a time,
which means that in each validation region only one background type has to give a dominant contribution with respect to all other backgrounds.

\subsection{Prompt opposite-sign dileptons}

The first validation region is defined by using exactly the same event selection as for the signal region,
but requiring the two leptons to have opposite charges. 
This validation region does not test any background specifically.
MC-based background estimation is normalized by the luminosity of the data sample.
This is why overall normalization of the simulation to the data in the opposite-sign region verifies trigger and lepton reconstruction efficiencies.
The correct description of the Z peak shape in data by the MC simulation tests electron scale momentum and resolution.
In \FigureRef{fig:OS_CR} invariant mass of opposite-sign electron pairs is shown.
In \TableRef{tab:dilep_isoOS} observed and expected number of the electron pairs are shown as well.
Good agreement between data and simulation can be seen.

\subsection{Prompt same-sign dileptons}
% TODO table with final numbers to show how good MC normalization is wrt to data.

Same-sign dilepton prompt background originates dominantly from $WZ$ and $ZZ$ processes, where both Z and W bosons decay leptonicaly.
In order to check normalization of these processes, a prompt validation region is used.
In a fully reconstructed event, where one of these processes took place, one can find at least one same-sign and one opposite-sign lepton pairs.
In order to enhance $WZ$ and $ZZ$ contributions in the validation region, at least three leptons are required in the event, where one lepton pair
has to be a same-sign electron pair and other one - an opposite-sign same-flavour pair (from $Z$ boson decay). 
Invariant mass of the opposite-sign pair has to be close to the $Z$ boson mass $(|m_{\Plepton\Plepton} - m_{Z}| < 10$ GeV$)$.

Expected and observed numbers of same-sign pairs in this region are listed in \TableRef{tab:promptCR_yields}, 
and the ratios between observed and expected number of pairs are summarized in \TableRef{tab:prompt_ratios}. 
The expectations are in good agreement with observation.

\subsection{Electron charge flip}

As was described above, events with opposite-sign lepton pairs in the final state can be reconstructed as same-sign lepton pairs, 
if charge of one of the leptons was wrongly identified.
Misidentification probability is well modelled as a function of $p_T$ by MC simulation, 
but $\eta$-dependence has to be corrected by scale factors obtained with a data-driven method.
One can make a sanity check, comparing data from $Z$ peak window (same-sign pairs with invariant mass $80 < m_{ee} < 100$~GeV)
with the MC simulation corrected by the charge flip scale factors.

Invariant mass of the same-sign pairs within $Z$ peak window is shown in \FigureRef{fig:charge_flip_CR_inv_mass}. 
$p_T$ and $\eta$ distribution for the leading electron are shown in \FigureRef{fig:charge_flip_CR_kinematics}.
A good agreement is observed, which demonstrates correctness of the derived charge flip scale factor.

Observed and expected numbers of electron pairs are also shown in \TableRef{tab:ee_isoSS_Z} for combined $e^{\pm}e^{\pm}$ and separately for $e^{+}e^{+}$ and $e^{-}e^{-}$ pairs.

\subsection{Non-prompt background validation region}
% TODO [explain here how fake factors for validation regions were calculated]

To verify the fake factor method, a set of validation regions is checked. 
These regions have to be as much as possible kinematically close to
the nominal signal selection as well as to the looser signal selection, 
which is used in non-prompt background estimation with \EquationRef{eq:fake_pred}.

Looser signal selection has weaker isolation requirements and a weaker 
electron identification requirement compared to the nominal selection.
This is why two validation regions are used, one of which is identical
to the nominal signal selection, except for the weaker isolation cut, and another
one - except for the weaker identification requirement. 
Schematic representation of the signal and validation regions is shown
in \FigureRef{fig:fake_validation_regions}. 
Looser selections for the
validation regions which were used for fake factor calculation are shown
as well. As can be seen from the figure, such design of the validation
region allows to test non-prompt estimation for signal region in the 
best way possible.

\caption{Schematic representation of the kinematic phase space of non-prompt validation regions with respect to signal region.}
\label{fig:fake_validation_regions}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In total, four different validation regions were defined.
One validation region consists from same-sign electron pairs, where both electrons pass the signal region isolation requirement, 
but fail ``tight'' electron identification requirement, while passing ``medium''.
The second validation region consists from same-sign electron pairs, where both electrons fail the signal isolation requirement
but pass a looser intermediate isolation cut, which is loosened by 4 GeV, instead.
The third and fourth validation regions are identical to the second one but require only the leading (third region) or the subleading (fourth region)
electron to fail the signal isolation requirement, but pass a looser intermediate isolation cut instead.

\FigureRef{fig:fakeCR_part1} and \FigureRef{fig:fakeCR_part2} show the invariant mass distributions for the validation regions descried above. 
The agreement between observation and prediction is generally good.  
\TableRef{tab:ee_fakeCR} shows the expected and observed numbers of electron pairs. 
The uncertainties quoted are statistical only.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:ss_Systematics}
% TODO [add Fast/Full sim. systematics]

A set of possible systematic sources which can affect background predictions were studied.
Description of the considered sources are presented below.
Systematic uncertainties related to the data-driven methods for non-prompt and charge flip background estimations
were described in \SectionRef{subsec:fakes_description} and \SectionRef{subsec:CF_definition} respectively.

\subsection{Electron reconstruction}
Several systematic uncertainties are related to the electron reconstruction procedure.
These uncertainties are provided by the ATLAS e/gamma working group which works on electron and photon identification performance of the ATLAS detector.
They provide recommendations and uncertainty estimations for all physics analyses which use electron or photon final states.

Electron reconstruction and ``tight'' identification efficiencies are obtained with tag-and-probe methods using
events with leptonic decays of $W$ and $Z$ bosons as well as $J/\psi$ mesons.
Reconstruction efficiency uncertainty range between 1.3-2.4\% depending on $\eta$, while
``tight'' identification efficiency uncertainty range between 2.0-2.8\% depending on both $p_T$ and $\eta$~\cite{electron_reco_id_2011}.

Reconstruction of the electron energy is optimized using multivariate algorithms.
Electron energy scale and energy resolution are obtained using electrons from Z boson decays.
Their uncertainties are provided as a function of $p_T$ and $\eta$~\cite{electron_energy_errors_Run1} 
by the working group as well.

The total effect of these uncertainties on total background prediction 
is shown under the name ``Electron reconstruction and identification'' in \TableRef{tab:syst}.

\subsection{Trigger and luminosity}
Trigger efficiency for electrons with different $p_T$ and $\eta$ has some uncertainty as well.
This uncertainty is estimated to be at $\sim1\%$ level by the ATLAS trigger groups.
The resulting uncertainty on the yield in the signal region is different, since there are two leptons that can pass the trigger requirement. 

To scale the background prediction obtained with MC simulation to the data 
one has to know an integrated luminosity of the collected data sample. 
This is why a luminosity uncertainty propagates to all the backgrounds measured using MC simulation.
The integrated luminosity uncertainty in 2012 is equal to 2.8$\%$~\cite{Aad:2013ucp} 
and it was obtained in a similar way to that described in \SectionRef{sec:lucid_performance}.

\subsection{Statistics and the theoretical cross section}
% TODO describe how much statistics (wrt data lumi) samples had!
Limited number of simulated events in the Monte Carlo samples lead to an additional uncertainty which is listed as ``MC statistics'' in \TableRef{tab:syst}.
This uncertainty also includes effect of the limited number of events in data sets used in data-driven methods to measure the charge flip rate and the fake factor.
Statistical uncertainty is significant for high-mass region.

% TODO describe who did all this tests and variations! Who it was???
As one can see from \TableRef{tab:MC_cross}, different processes were simulated using different MC generators and PDF sets.
Additional uncertainty arises from  their choice.
To estimate these uncertainties, different MC generators, parton shower and hadronization models are tested.
Uncertainty on PDF and strong coupling constant $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ are estimated by using different PDF sets following recommendations from~\cite{pdf4lhc}.
Also renormalization and factorization scales are varied by a factor of two to estimate an effect on total cross section of the processes.
The summary list of uncertainties used in the analysis is shown in \TableRef{tab:systematics_common}.
Detailed information about cross section calculations and their errors for some processes 
are reported in~\cite{diboson_cross_section,ttW_cross_section,ttV_cross_section}.

\section{Signal Region}
\label{sec:ss_signalRegion}

Same-sign lepton pair invariant mass in the signal region is shown in~\FigureRef{fig:signal_mass}.
The last bin in the histogram is an overflow bin, which includes pairs with invariant mass higher than 600 GeV.
The observed number of pairs is compatible with the predicted background.
As one can see, the dominant background arises from the charge flip component.
Predicted contributions from each background processes with different invariant mass cuts are shown in \TableRef{tab:2iso_ee_SS}.
In \FigureRef{fig:signal_kinematics}, kinematics of the leading lepton is shown. 
In \FigureRef{fig:delta_phi}, angle between same-sign electrons in the pair is shown as well.
Background prediction describes observed numbers in all of these distributions reasonable well within uncertainties bands.

\subsection{Limit setting}

Background prediction describes data very well and there are no significant visible deviations which could indicate a potential presence of the BSM signal.
The idea of this analysis is to be as general as possible and to perform a search for the a new physics without favoring any BSM model.
This is why the next step is to calculate exclusion limits on the new physics with same-sign lepton pairs.

Due to the limited acceptance of the detector the signal region was designed to use the most efficient phase space possible.
This is why the cross section of the process, $\sigma$, relates with the measured cross section in the signal region, the so-called fiducial cross section, $\sigma^{fid}$, as:
\begin{equation}
 \sigma = \dfrac{\sigma^{fid}}{<N_{pair}>A}
 \label{eq:cross_section}
\end{equation}
where $<N_{pair}>$ is the average number of same-sign pairs produced per event and $A$ is the fiducial acceptance (or volume).
Definition of the fiducial volume is discussed in \SectionRef{subsec:fid_volume_eff}.

The cross section limits are derived using a $CLs$~\cite{CLs_tecnique,CLs_2} prescription with the help of the RooStat~\cite{RooStat_project} framework 
provided by the ATLAS Statistics Committee. $CLs$ method state that the signal hypothesis is excluded at the confidence level $CL$ when
\begin{equation}
 1 - CL_s \leq CL
\end{equation}
where $CL_s$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
 CL_s \equiv \dfrac{CL_{s+b}}{CL_b}
\end{equation}
where $CL_b$ is a confidence level observed for the background-only hypothesis and $CL_{s+b}$ - for the background plus signal hypothesis.
In practise, $CL_b$ ($CL_{s+b}$) is a probability to find the observed data given an expected background (background plus signal).
This probability is Poisson-distributed and is calculated basing on the number of observed and expected same-sign electron pairs in the signal region.
A used test-statistics for the limit settings is a log likelihood ratio test.
\toAsk[<--is it correct to say like this?] Systematic uncertainties and their correlations between each other are taken into account during the limit settings.
For example, the charge-flip scale factor uncertainty is correlated across Drell-Yan, $t\bar{t}$, $WW$ and $W\gamma$ background samples.
Experimental errors such as electron reconstruction, identification, energy scale and trigger 
are treated as one uncertainty and correlated across all the expected backgrounds and signal.
MC cross section errors are independent except for dibosons ($ZZ$, $WZ$ and $WW$).
The luminosity is common to all the background samples, so it is naturally correlated.
Statistical errors are independent.

Following this prescription and using number of expected and observed same-sign lepton pairs one can compute 
upper limits at a given confidence level (typically at 95$\%$ level) on the number of same-sign lepton pairs ($N_{95}$)
contributed by the new physics beyond the SM. Limits can be set for different invariant mass thresholds, 
because dilepton invariant mass is the main observable for the analysis.
Limits on the number of pairs can be translated to the upper limits on fiducial cross section as:
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_{95}^{fid} = \dfrac{N_{95}}{\epsilon_{fid} \times \int \mathscr{L} dt}
 \label{eq:fid_cross_section}
\end{equation}
where $\int \mathscr{L} dt$ is an integrated luminosity of the data and $\epsilon_{fid}$ is a fiducial efficiency for finding a same-sign electron pair from
a possible signal from new physics in the fiducial volume, which is described in \SectionRef{subsec:fid_volume_eff}.

% TODO explain fiducial efficiency

\subsection{Fiducial volume and fiducial efficiency}
\label{subsec:fid_volume_eff}

As can be seen from \EquationRef{eq:cross_section} and \EquationRef{eq:fid_cross_section}, in order to translate the number of measured and expected lepton pairs 
to the cross section limit of the potential signal from new physics, one has to know the fiducial volume and efficiency.
The reason is that the detector does not reconstruct leptons 100$\%$ efficiently, and it does not cover the whole phase space around the interaction point.
Fiducial volume represents the phase space region that is truncated in a manner that mimics the detector acceptance.
It is defined by a set of cuts on the truth (generator) level. 
Kinematic cuts on the electrons are identical to the one used in the signal region definition on the reconstruction level:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Leading electron $p_T > 25$ GeV
 \item Subleading electron $p_T > 20$ GeV
 \item $|\eta|<1.37$ or $1.52<|\eta|<2.47$
\end{itemize}
Requirements on the electron pair are the same as well:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Same-sign pair with $m_{ee} > 15$ GeV
 \item Veto pairs with $70 < m_{ee} < 110$ GeV
 \item No opposite-sign same-flavour pairs with $|m_{ee} - m_{Z}| < 10$ GeV
\end{itemize}
Since electrons are required to be isolated on the reconstruction level, isolation has to be applied on the truth level as well.
Track-based isolation on truth level is identical to the one on reconstruction level:
all charged particles within the cone $\Delta R < 0.3$ around the electron with $p_T > 0.4$ GeV are considered and
sum of their $p_T$ has to be not larger than 10$\%$ of the electron $p_T$.
Calorimeter-based isolation was not applied on the truth level due to a significantly different behavior of the cuts on the reconstruction and truth levels.

As one can see, cuts on the truth level are identical to those used on the reconstruction level.
In a case of an ideal detector, fiducial volume would completely correspond to the geometrical detector acceptance.
But because the real detector does not provide a 100$\%$ reconstruction efficiency, in order to relate the fiducial volume with the real geometrical detector acceptance
a fiducial efficiency is used, which is defined as:
\begin{equation}
 \epsilon_{fid} = \dfrac{N_r}{N_f}
\end{equation}
where $N_f$ is the number of electron pairs which pass the fiducial volume cuts on the truth level and $N_r$ - which pass the fiducial volume cuts on the truth level, 
as well as all the signal selection cuts on the reconstruction level.

In order to perform a search for new physics in a model-independent way, one wants the fiducial efficiency to be constant and not depending on the type of the BSM model.
However, different models provide different $p_T$ and $\eta$ spectra, and electron reconstruction efficiency depends on both $p_T$ and $\eta$.
As reported in~\cite{electron_tight}, efficiency can vary up to 15$\%$ for ``tight'' identification criteria with respect to the electron $p_T$.
Also, presence and number of jets in the final state, which is model dependent, affects electron isolation efficiency, which will have an effect on 
the fiducial efficiency as well.

In order to estimate the value of the fiducial efficiency, efficiencies for four different BSM models were calculated:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Doubly charged Higgs. This model assumes production of two doubly charged scalar bosons which, decaying leptonically, will provide two pairs of same-sign leptons.
 No jets are produced in the final state. A range of 100-1000 GeV of double charged Higgs was considered.
 \item Colored Zee-Babu model. It assumes production of a diquark, which decays to two leptoquarks with the same charge, 
 which in their turn decay to lepton and quark. The final state consists of one same-sign lepton pair plus two jets.
 Masses considered in the model were 2.5-3.5 TeV for the diquark and 1-1.4 TeV for leptoquarks.
 \item Production of a heavy right-handed $W_R$ boson and a heavy Majorana neutrino. $W_R$ decays to a lepton and a Majorana neutrino, 
 which decays to a $W$ boson and another lepton. The final state consists of one same-sign pair and products of the W boson decay.
 Mass of $W_R$ was between 1 TeV and 2 TeV, while mass of the Majorana neutrino was in the range of 0.25-1.5 TeV
 \item Pair production of the fourth generation down-type quark. Both quarks decay semi-leptonically to $t$ quark and then to $b$ quark.
 The final state consists of two jets and four W bosons. At least two same-sign bosons have to decay leptonically in order to provide a same-sign lepton pair.
 This state is characterized by large hadron activity due to high jet multiplicity.
 Mass of the fourth generation quark was varied from 400 GeV to 1 TeV.
\end{itemize}
Fiducial efficiencies for these models were calculated with different dilepton mass thresholds.
Obtained efficiencies are in the range of 48-74$\%$. The lowest efficiency was given by the fourth generation down-type quark, while the highest one - 
by the heavy right-handed $W_R$ boson and heavy Majorana neutrino. The latter model had a larger efficiency with respect to the doubly charged Higgs model
because the final state of the doubly charged Higgs model contains two same-sign pairs against one pair in the Majorana model.
Efficiencies were measured separately for positive and negative same-sign pairs, but no significant difference was observed.

To provide conservative cross section limit setting for new physics beyond the SM, the lowest obtained efficiency, which was 48.3$\%$, was used.

\subsection{Fiducial cross section limits}

Computed upper limits at the 95$\%$ confidence level on the fiducial cross section ($\sigma_{95}^{fid}$)
of the new physics beyond the SM for different invariant mass thresholds based on the values from \TableRef{tab:2iso_ee_SS}
are shown in \FigureRef{fig:inclusive_fid_limit}. Separate limits for positive and negative same-sign pairs are shown in \FigureRef{fig:signal_kinematics}.

\section{Mass limits on doubly charged Higgs}
As an example of a BSM model which produces same-sign lepton pairs in the final state, a pair production of doubly charged Higgs bosons was studied.
The search strategy is the same as described above.
Since the final state of this model has two same-sign pairs of leptons, no jet activity or no missing transverse energy in the event, 
there is no need to optimize signal selection.
Doubly charged Higgs decay should be visible as a sharp peak in the dilepton invariant mass.
This is why using fiducial efficiency calculated in bins of 100 GeV (as it was done for the fiducial limit calculations) is not optimal from the point of view signal sensitivity.
Thus, the search is performed in mass bins with mass-dependent width.

\subsection{MC simulation}
A few signal samples were generated with Pythia8~\cite{pythia8} with different masses of the left-handed and right-handed doubly charged Higgs bosons.
Simulated masses were in the range of 50-600 GeV in steps of 50 GeV and one sample had 1 TeV mass.
Kinematics of the left-handed and right-handed Higgs bosons is identical, but production rate is different due to the different coupling to Z boson mediator~\cite{dch_note}. Cross sections were calculated with NLO precision. 
% TODO [link] for NLO cross section

\subsection{Model acceptance and efficiency}
The width of the doubly charged Higgs decay is mainly caused by the detector momentum resolution of the electrons.
Since the decay width becomes larger with the invariant mass, the search was performed in the mass bins with variable width.
The idea behind the mass bin widths optimization is based on two facts. On one hand, a mass bin has to cover as much signal as possible,
but on the other hand, background contribution in the mass bin is desired to be as small as possible.
To satisfy both conditions, the signal significance, $S$, was chosen as an optimization criterion:
\begin{equation}
 S = \sqrt{ 2((s+B)ln(1+s/B)-s } 
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the expected signal and $B=b+\delta b^2$ is the predicted background plus background systematic uncertainty squared.
A bin width is parameterized as a second degree polynomial of the Higgs mass.
Coefficients of the polynomial were the parameters to optimize.
During the optimization procedure it became clear that there is a third effect which has to be taken into account.
Due to the limited statistics of the predicted background, one cannot have too many mass bins, otherwise cross section
exclusion limit will fluctuate very much from bin to bin. 
The optimal bin width parameterization was found to be $\pm(0.04 \times m(\dch) + 0.2 \cdot 10^{-4} \times m(\dch)^{2})$,
where $m(\dch)$ is the Higgs mass.

The next step is to define how many lepton pairs produced in Higgs boson decays are reconstructed, selected and fall into appropriate mass bin.
The number of generated Higgs bosons is known, 
thus one only needs to count number of reconstructed same-sign pairs which pass signal selection and fall into appropriate mass bins.
The ratio of reconstructed to the total number of generated pairs corresponds to the total efficiency, which includes acceptance and efficiency of the signal selection.
Efficiencies for each mass point were calculated, but in order to interpolate between the simulated mass points, the total efficiency, $\varepsilon_{tot}$, is fitted by
an empirical piecewise function:
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{tot}(m) = \begin{cases} p_{0} (1-e^{-(m-p_{1})/p_{2}}) & ,\mbox{if } m < 450\mbox{ GeV} \\ 
p_{3} + p_{4} m & ,\mbox{if } m \geq 450\mbox{ GeV} \end{cases}
\label{eq:ee_eff}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the Higgs mass and $p_{0}, p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}$ are fit parameters, shown in \TableRef{tab:ee_eff_params}.

\subsection{Cross section and mass limits}

Invariant mass distribution for the same-sign electron pairs together with the signal from the left-handed Higgs 
with masses 300 GeV and 500 GeV superimposed are shown in \FigureRef{fig:signal_mass}.
Branching ratio of the $H^{\pm\pm} \to e^{\pm}e^{\pm}$ decay is assumed to be 100$\%$.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The upper cross section limit on pair production of the doubly charged Higgs is set in the same way as the limits on the new physics described above.
A cross section is determined as:
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_{HH}\times BR =\frac{N_{H}^{rec}}{2\times A\times \epsilon \times \int \mathscr{L} dt}
\end{equation}
where BR is the branching ratio of the $H^{\pm\pm} \to e^{\pm}e^{\pm}$ decay, 
$N_{H}^{rec}$ is the number of reconstructed $H^{\pm\pm}$, $A\times \epsilon$ is the total efficiency described earlier and
$\int \mathscr{L} dt$ is integrated luminosity.
Factor 2 in the denominator is needed to take into account presence of two same-sign pairs from $H^{++}$ and $H^{--}$ in the event.

The upper cross section limit times branching ratio (which is assumed to be 100$\%$) at 95$\%$ CL is shown in \FigureRef{fig:dch_limits_mass}.
The scatter between mass bins is caused by fluctuations of the predicted background due to the low statistics in bins.
A good agreement between expected and observed limit lines can be seen, and all deviations lay within $2\sigma$.
The theoretical cross section curves as a function of Higgs mass for left- and right-handed doubly charged Higgs bosons 
are shown as well.
Lower mass limits of the model correspond to the intersection of the theoretical curve with the expected cross section limit. Obtained
mass limits are summarized in \TableRef{tab:limits_mass}.

Limits above can also be interpreted as mass limits as a function of the branching ratio for $H^{\pm\pm}_L$ and $H^{\pm\pm}_R$ decays.
They are shown in \FigureRef{fig:dch_limits_BR}.
