\chapter{Dark Matter Mono-W models}
\label{chap:monoW}


\section{Introduction}

Another possible BSM signature which can be easily tested in signal region is
associated production of pair of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP), 
which are candidates for dark matter (DM) particles, with SM W. 
In this scenario MET will consist not only from neutrino from W decay but as 
well from pair of WIMPs.

In this chapter qualitative study based on using different popular(???) models are presented 
which address question is(???) our signal selection could be sensitive to such 
kind of models.


% While searching for $\PWprime$ boson one can naivly expect that distributions of 
% transferred energy of decay products will look quite similar, which
% means that distributions of transfer lepton momentum and missing energy will 
% look the same as well. But if we consider pair-production of dark matter

\section{Theoretical models}

There are two common approaches of DM: Effective Field Theories (EFT) approach simplified models. \\
EFT approach allows us to describe the DM-SM interactions mediated by all kinematically inaccesible particles in a universal way. 
It allows us derive stringent bounds on the ``new physics'' scale $\Lambda$~\cite{arXiv:1506.03116}. 
Simplified models are charachterized by the most important state mediating the DM particle interaction with SM. Unlike EFT approach,
simplified models are able to describe correctly the full kinematics of DM production, because they resolve the EFT contact interaction int single-particle 
s-channel or t-channel exchange~\cite{arXiv:1506.03116}. 

% TODO: explanation of simplified and EFT models (take from DM forum report or fro Bell's papers).


% and mediator connect SM interaction from one side and DM 

% TODO find reference from DM forum report which explain idea of simlified models 
% (that we introduce additionla mediator which on one side interact with SM particles and on other side - with dark matter particles).
% same for EFT models. But for now skip this part.

% TODO describe possible type of interection for mono-W models.

% TODO figure out what does it mean constructive and destructive intereference for DX models?

% TODO explanation for contact interaction is needed as well, ha-ha-ha...

% TODO say that our main focus is on simplified models because they are recommended by Dark Matter forum.

In simplfied model W is produced as initial state radiation from one of incoming quarks \FigureRef{fig:feynMonoWSimple}. 
For EFT approach W can be produces as final state particle \FigureRef{fig:feynMonoWEFT} as well as initial state radiation \FigureRef{fig:feynMonoWEFT}.

Current study cover both s- and t-channel simplified models with different mass of mediator $Z'$ and with different mass of DM particles.
EFT approach are represented by two models which correspond to two diagram which are shown at \FigureRef{fig:feynMonoWEFT}. 
They charachterize by energy scale of ``new physics'' $\Lambda$ (or effective mass $M^{*}$) as well as mass of produced DM particles.
Both models assume vector type of interaction between DM and SM sectors. For D52 model (which correspond to the right diagram in  \FigureRef{fig:feynMonoWEFT}) 
we consider only constructive interferance with SM.

\section{Sensitivity studies}

Main idea of the study was to investigate possibility to exploit signal selection for search for different DM models and to understand sensitivity for such models.
Main charachteristic of the signal selection was focus of high-$m_{T}$ region in order to get rid of dominant SM W background.
In order to evaluate possible contribution to the signal region main kinematic distribution of DM models were studied and compared to the reference signal from $\PWprime$ model.
It's worth to mention that due to the fact that mass of DM particles doesn't affect kinematic distribution of the event for all simulated DM samples mass of DM particle was set to 1 GeV.
(should some plots to be shown to proof this???).

% TODO show comparison of t- and s-channel
% TODO include plot which show comparison of s- and t-channels.

In \FigureRef{fig:kinematicsSChannel} normalized kinematic distributions of transverse mass of lepton and MET, transverse lepton momentum and MET 
for s-channel simplified model as well as EFT models with comparison with $\PWprime$ model are shown.
First distinguishable charachteristic of all DM models is that there is no peak structures in any kinematic distribution, which is expected because transverse missing energy is formed by
neutrino from W boson decay and two DM particles which are independable with each other. Second feature of DM models that main contribution are tends to be in low-$m_{T}$ region.
Especially it concern simplified models, for which dominant contribution is outside of signal region for any parameter of mediator mass.
But with increasing of mass of mediator $m_{T}$ distribution tends to become more flat and moves towards high-$m_{T}$ region.
But with increasing mediator mass cross section of process significantly decreasing (see \TableRef{tab:TriggerDetails}) 
and for mass equal 10 TeV cross section is a few order of magnitude lower than background (need proof, find plot ???) which makes signal selection not sensitive for s-channel simplified DM model.

% TODO reprhase it. It not visible from table - only from non-normalized plot. Plot should be mono-W with W backgound only? Or I should also include other backgounds?
% TODO add Wprime to the table.
% TODO add not-normalized kinematic plots.

\end{figure}

In \FigureRef{fig:kinematicsTChannel} similar normalized kinematic distribution are show for t-channel simplified model. Distribution for t-channel model looks almost identical to one
for s-channel. But cross sections for t-channel processes are for one-two order of magnitude lower compared to s-channel (see \TableRef{tab:TriggerDetails}) which leads to conclution
that signal selection even less sensitive for t-channel simplified model.

Transverse mass distribution for both EFT models looks similar and majority (???) of the signal lays in the signal region. 
% Cross section for both processes strongly depends on energy scale of new physics $\Lambda$ (or effective mediator mass for D52 model).
% Dependence of cross section for WW$\chi\chi$ model versus energy scale is shown in \FigureRef{fig:lambdaScan}.

\section{Validity of EFT approach and summary}

Cross section for both EFT processes strongly depends on energy scale of new physics $\Lambda$ (or effective mediator mass for D52 model).
Dependence of cross section for WW$\chi\chi$ model versus energy scale is shown in \FigureRef{fig:lambdaScan}.
In order for WW$\chi\chi$ process have sizeable cross section with $\PWprime$ 2 TeV model which we use as a reference in this study, energy scale of new physics $\Lambda$
has to be of order 200-300 GeV. But according to ~\cite{arXiv:1512.00476}: 
``The EFT approximation is valid when the momentum transfer in a given
process of interest is much smaller than the mass of the mediating
particle. For momentum transfer larger than or comparable to
$\Lambda$, the EFT description will break down.''
Moment transfer for 13 TeV collisions at LHC correspond to scale of few TeV, which mean that $\Lambda$ has to be of order of TeV in order for model to be valid.
