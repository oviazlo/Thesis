\section{Introduction}

% physics --> trying to describe everything with laws and models from fundametal principa and ideally we want to create an absolute model which will describe everything.

Particle physics, like any field of science, is based on the two pillars: experiment and theory.
The aim of the particle physics is to construct a universal theory which will explain behavior of the universe.
However, this requires good understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the universe and how they interact.
In order to do so one need to have possibility to quantify observed effects by making precise measurements.
By collecting enough experimental results one aim to construct a model which will be able to describe all measurements done.
More different measurements model is able describe more confidence one can have that model works and that it can be used to predict 
unmeasured effects yet. This was the case with so-called Standard Model (SM) which became extremely popular in last century because
it was able to describe hundreds of new observed particle in the particle colliding experiments.
The SM describes with remarkable precision three types of particle interactions with only gravitational type left undescribed.
Thus a big effort is ongoing to try to incorporate the gravity into the SM to obtain an complete model.

However, despite the fact that SM agrees amazingly well with experimental evidences and even if one will not take gravity into account 
there are are many reasons to think that SM is not complete.
These reasons are based on set of unsolved questions which SM cannot address (e.g. neutrino masses, dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry).
Because all known elementary particles fits well in the SM, thus problems make us believe that there are
potentially new physics (and new particles which correspond to it) in TeV or above-TeV regimes which can solve these problems.
Start of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provide us possibility to look inside the TeV energy frontier.
This is why many analysis are focused to investigate new energy regime and look for possible deviations from the SM which can be hints to new physics.
Since SM was well established more than 30 years ago many theorists spent tremendous amount of time to create
plethora of the models which extend SM and address multiple unsolved problems. These models can predict final signatures and selections which are most sensitive to 
the possible new physics and motivate strategies of the searches.

This chapter contains brief description of the SM model, it's problems and consider a few of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) models which can address some unsolved SM questions.

\section{The Standard Model}

\subsection{Elementary particles}

% *****************
% INTRO
% *****************

The SM is a very successful model which describes all the known particles in existence to a remarkable degree of accuracy.
All of the SM particles are fundamental particles (have no internal structure) that make up the matter and forces in the universe.
The elementary particles can be classified into two groups: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item the spin-1/2 fermions which obey Fermi-Dirac statistics
 \item the bosons which obey Bose-Einstein statistics and have an integer spin values.
\end{itemize}

% *****************
% FERMIONS
% *****************
Matter in the universe is made up from fermions, which are classified into three generations.
Each generation consists from two electromagnetically charged quarks and one lepton as well as an associated neutral neutrino.
Fermions from different generations have the same charges but differ by the mass.
One quark from the generation have charge +2/3$e$ while other have -1/3$e$. Lepton carry an integer charge -1$e$.
There are experimental evidences which support that the number of fermion generation has to be equal three~\cite{three_lepton_generations}.
Each higher generation consist from more heavy particles which tend to decay to the lighter particles from lower generations which can be
interpreted as an explanation why matter is made from the first generation particles.
In addition to the electrical charge quarks also carry colour charge, 
which allows for the same flavour quarks to coexist inside one hadron without violating the Pauli principle.
There are three different colour within SM namely red, green and blue.
Number of colours have been experimentally confirmed from the measurements of the ratio of the hadronic cross section 
to the $\mu^+\mu^-$ production cross section in the electron-positron annihilation. \toDo[add link]
Each of the fermions have an associated anti-particle, which is the particle with opposite charges but with identical mass and spin.
List of fermions and their properties are summarized in \TableRef{tab:fermions}.

The remaining particles described by the SM are bosons. Those particle have an integer values of spin.
List of all known elementary boson is shown in \TableRef{tab:bosons}.
There are many experimental evidences that proof existence of bosons.
The first evidence of the Z and W bosons were done by the UA1 and UA2 collaborations~\cite{ARNISON1983103, BAGNAIA1983130}
which made the first measurements of their masses.
The Higgs boson have been discovered the latest by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in 2012~\cite{Aad2012tfa, Chatrchyan2012ufa}.

\subsection{Type of interactions and fields}
% quanta of interaction fields

The SM is the Quantum Field Theory that describes the interactions between the particles.
There are three fundamental forces (other than gravitation) which are incorporated into the SM framework: the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces. These forces are mediated between the matter particles (elementary or composite) by carrier particles with integer spin (spin 1), which are called gauge bosons.
Each fundamental force has its own gauge boson: the electromagnetic force is mediated via an exchange of massless photons, the strong force is mediated by gluons, while the weak force is transmitted by massive W and Z bosons.
In the quantum field theories the forces are interpreted as dynamics of the quantized, relativistic and locally interacting fields.
The electromagnetic, weak and strong forces have different field strength and work over different ranges (see \TableRef{tab:bosons}). 
Both types of matter particles, leptons and quarks, interact through the electromagnetic and weak forces (except neutrinos, which interact only weekly), whereas only quarks interact strongly.

The SM combines two main theories built to describe all of three fundamental interactions, the force-carrier bosons and the matter particles. The first one is Glashow-Salam-Weinberg (GSW) theory which unifies the electromagnetic and weak interactions. The second theory, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), describes the strong interactions of quarks and gluons. Both GSW and QCD theories are constrained by principles of local gauge invariance of the fields based on the $U(1)_Y\times SU(2)_{L}$ weak isospin and hypercharge, and $SU(3)_C$ color symmetry groups, respectively. Thus, the SM is a Quantum Field Theory based on $U(1)_Y\times SU(2)_{L}\times SU(3)_C$ symmetry group with $1+3+8=12$ generators that correspond to 12 massless gauge bosons (see \TableRef{tab:bosons}), if the gauge symmetry is unbroken. Remarkably that both GSW and QCD theories, unlike the QED, are non-abelian that determines the property of the self-interactions between the corresponding gauge boson fields. In particular, self-interaction of gluon field leads to an important characteristic of the QCD such as the assymptotic freedom and confinement.

The weak W and Z bosons are experimentally observed to be massive, indicating that the electro-weak sector of the SM is spontaneously broken. 
In the SM the spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented by the Higgs mechanism. In this approach,
a doublet of complex fields is introduced which interacts with all the SM particles and has a potential with infinite number of degenerate vacuum states. 
The choice of one particular ground state with nonzero vacuum expectation value, $v$, breaks the $SU(2)$ symmetry and results into one scalar neutral particle (Higgs boson) that must be present in the SM. As was mentioned above the existence of the Higgs boson have been confirmed recently.

The Higgs mechanism allows to give masses not only to charged and neutral gauge bosons, but also to the fermions through the corresponding Yukawa coupling terms. An important property of the Higgs field is that it flips the left-handed fermions into right-handed fermions and vice versa. 
As the right-handed neutrinos were not observed and, thus, are assumed to not exist, the left-handed
neutrinos can not interact with Higgs and remain massless within the SM.

SM have been tested by hundreds of measurements by many different experiments.
All measurements were in remarkably well agreement with theoretical calculation.

\section{Physics Beyond the Standard Model}

\subsection{Problems of the Standard Model}

The SM is currently the best description of the micro-world. It predicted many particles before their discovery. However, despite its great phenomenological success, the SM does not describe a full picture and is believed to be incomplete. The following $big$ $questions$~\cite{Gershtein:2013iqa} remain unsolved within the SM:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{The particle origin of the dark matter.} An existence of the dark matter is confirmed in the astrophysics and cosmology. The most compelling hypothesis is that the dark matter is made out of massive neutral particles weakly interacting with the matter (WIMPs). They are expected to have a mass of an order less than a TeV. At this scenario the WIMPs can be directly produced at high energy colliders.
\item \textit{Origin of the mass.} The Higgs Mechanism is introduced in the SM by hand. The Higgs boson if the first scalar elementary particle observed in nature. It gives masses to the vector bosons and fermions. However, the SM does not tell us why this happens. Not clear if this particle is fundamental or composite, if there are other Higgs bosons.
\item \textit{Hierarchy problem.} The mass of the Higgs boson contains the large contributions from radiative loop corrections. In particular, it is sensitive to heavy particles of the SM as well as to hypothetical particles of new physics that might lie at the TeV scale. If there is no physics beyond the SM, these corrections become quadratically divergent leading to an unnaturally high mass of the Higgs boson. It is possible to restore the Higgs mass to a proper value through the $fine-tuning$, but this is considered to be unnatural. The new physics that allows to eliminate this fine-tuning predicts new particles at the TeV scale.
\item \textit{Origin of matter-antimatter assymetry.} An amount of matter and antimatter created after the Big Bang is expected to be equal. However, the universe visible from Earth is made almost entirely from the matter.
The possible explanation could come from new physics able to provide baryon number violation, CP-violation and new scalar particles at the TeV scale.
\item \textit{Origin of mass hierarchy of fermion masses.} The mass of the top quark is almost $10^6$ times larger than masses of up and down quarks. Discovery of new particles would provide additional clues to this puzzle.
\item \textit{Neutrino mass.} The experimental results on neutrino oscillations~\cite{Fukuda:1998fd} confirm that neutrinos are massive particles. However, in the SM no mass term for the neutrino particles is incorporated. An extension of the SM with a model containing a massive right-handed, sterile neutrino can solve this problem. In such model the physical spectrum of the SM neutrinos acquire masses through so-called $seesaw$ mechanism~\cite{Mohapatra:1979ia}.
\item \textit{Gravity is not part of the SM.} The Quantum Field Theory, which provides a theoretical framework for the SM, is used to describe the micro-world, while the General Relativity is used to describe the macro-world. It is not easy task to fit them into a single framework of the SM comfortably. However, the unification is possible in the context of String Theory, where a $graviton$ could be the corresponding force-carrying particle.
\end{itemize}

These questions unsolved by the SM motivate us to continue searches for new physics beyond the SM at the TeV scale and higher.

\subsection{Models beyond the Standard Model}
\label{subsec:bsm_models}
Despite of the described problems above, the incredible accuracy of the SM thus far measured up to TeV scale leads to the understanding that SM 
is simply incomplete rather than incorrect. 
This is way a first step to build a new model which will address some of the problems is firstly to verify that it agrees with the SM predictions. 
This is why many new models aim to expand SM rather than to provide completely new approach. Such models are typically called Beyond Standard Models (BSM).
There are plethora of the models which address SM problems in many different ways. In current section only BSM models which produce new charged heavy gauge boson or produce same-sign dilepton final state, which are subjects of interest of the analyses presented in this thesis, will be discussed.

% GUT based models, particularly LRSM
There are many possibilities and ways to go beyond the SM. 
Some popular examples can be find in ref.~\cite{Ellis:2011jb}.
Many models are based on Grand Unified Theory~\cite{GUT_bigPaper},
which seek to find a simple symmetry group based which include SM symmetry
and contain all known interactions~\cite{Langacker:1984dc,Cvetic:1995zs}.
Model of interest for analyses described in thesis are $SO(10)$ group
which lead to intermediate symmetry:
\begin{equation}
SO(10) \to SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}
\end{equation}
It yields to the so-called Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), which adds
right-handed weak interaction to the SM and accordingly new right-handed $W_R$ and $Z_R$ gauge bosons.
The breaking of $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L} \to U(1)_Y$ occurs due to a triplet of complex Higgs fields, consisting of $\Delta^0_R, \Delta^+_R$ and $\Delta^{++}_R$, at a high energy scale~\cite{Azuelos:2004mwa}.
Doubly-charged Higgs $\Delta^{++}_R$ can decay to two same-sign leptons which make it a signal candidate for a same-sign dilepton analysis descried in \ChapterRef{chap:SS}. Spontaneous breaking of this symmetry provides mass to the right-handed $W_R$.
Since $SU(2)_R$ symmetry is broken ar a higher energy scale than $SU(2)_L$ it makes
$W_R$ a signal candidate for analysis described in \ChapterRef{chap:Wprime}.
This model address a few SM problems. Firstly, it assumes Majorana nature of the neutrinos and assigns mass to them by a seesaw mechanism and allows scenarios such that the neutrino masses are naturally light~\cite{Mohapatra:1979ia}. 
Secondly, LRSM provides spontaneous parity breaking~\cite{Grimus:1993fx}, while in the SM parity is broken excplicitly.

% Little Higgs model
Another set of models are little Higgs models.
These models address hierarchy and fine-tuning problems described above.
Idea of models is that the Higgs boson becomes a pseudo-Goldstone boson due to some global symmetry breaking at a TeV energy scale and acquires a mass via it.
Than the quadratic divergence corrections present in the SM Higgs scalar mass calculation from one-loop contributions from the SM top quark and gauge bosons will be canceled 
by the identical contributions from new heavy gauge bosons and new heavy fermionic states (to oppose the top contribution) introduced by the model~\cite{Han:2003wu,Brak}.
These models assume production of doubly charged Higgs and new heavy charged gauge bosons which are particles of interest for the searches presented in thesis as well.

% Mention other models
Except models described above there are many other theories and models like Kaluza-Klein, Zee-Babu, SUSY and other which either assumes new charged spin-1 boson or same-sign dilepton final state which proves high potential of the BSM searches presented in the thesis.
